**Single electron-spin-resonance detection by microwave photon counting**—2023-01-06 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02653v2)]<br/>Zhiren Wang, Léo Balembois, Milos Rančić, Eric Billaud, Marianne Le Dantec, Alban Ferrier, Philippe Goldner, Sylvain Bertaina, Thierry Chanelière, Daniel Estève, Denis Vion, Patrice Bertet, Emmanuel Flurin

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is the method of choice for
characterizing paramagnetic impurities, with applications ranging from
chemistry to quantum computing, but it gives access only to ensemble-averaged
quantities due to its limited signal-to-noise ratio. Single-electron-spin
sensitivity has however been reached using spin-dependent photoluminescence,
transport measurements, and scanning-probe techniques. These methods are
system-specific or sensitive only in a small detection volume, so that
practical single spin detection remains an open challenge. Here, we demonstrate
single electron magnetic resonance by spin fluorescence detection, using a
microwave photon counter at cryogenic temperatures. We detect individual
paramagnetic erbium ions in a scheelite crystal coupled to a high-quality
factor planar superconducting resonator to enhance their radiative decay rate,
with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.9 in one second integration time. The
fluorescence signal shows anti-bunching, proving that it comes from individual
emitters. Coherence times up to 3 ms are measured, limited by the spin
radiative lifetime. The method has the potential to apply to arbitrary
paramagnetic species with long enough non-radiative relaxation time, and allows
single-spin detection in a volume as large as the resonator magnetic mode
volume ( 10 um^3 in the present experiment), orders of magnitude larger than
other single-spin detection techniques. As such, it may find applications in
magnetic resonance and quantum computing.

**Horizon brightened accelerated radiation in the background of braneworld black holes**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13557v1)]<br/>Ashmita Das, Soham Sen, Sunandan Gangopadhyay
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The concept of horizon brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) has brought
to us a distinct mechanism of particle production in curved spacetime. In this
manuscript we examine the HBAR phenomena for a braneworld black hole (BBH)
which emerges as an effective theory in our $(3+1)$ dimensional universe due to
the higher dimensional gravitational effects. Despite being somewhat similar to
the Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{\rm o}$m solution in general relativity, the BBH is
unique with respect to its charge term which is rather the tidal charge. In
this background, we study the transition probability of the atom due to the
atom-field interaction and the associated HBAR entropy. Both the quantities
acquire modifications over the standard Schwarzschild results and turn out to
be the function of the tidal charge. This modifications appear solely due to
the bulk gravitational effects as induced on the 3-brane. Studying the Wien's
displacement, we observe an important feature that the wavelengths of HBAR
corresponding to the Schwarzschild and the BBH, deviate from each other
depending on their masses. This deviation is found to be more pronounced for
the mass values slightly greater or comparable to the Planck mass.

**A Unified Framework for Trace-induced Quantum Kernels**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13552v1)]<br/>Beng Yee Gan, Daniel Leykam, Supanut Thanasilp
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum kernel methods are promising candidates for achieving a practical
quantum advantage for certain machine learning tasks. Similar to classical
machine learning, an exact form of a quantum kernel is expected to have a great
impact on the model performance. In this work we combine all trace-induced
quantum kernels, including the commonly-used global fidelity and local
projected quantum kernels, into a common framework. We show how generalized
trace-induced quantum kernels can be constructed as combinations of the
fundamental building blocks we coin "Lego" kernels, which impose an inductive
bias on the resulting quantum models. We relate the expressive power and
generalization ability to the number of non-zero weight Lego kernels and
propose a systematic approach to increase the complexity of a quantum kernel
model, leading to a new form of the local projected kernels that require fewer
quantum resources in terms of the number of quantum gates and measurement
shots. We show numerically that models based on local projected kernels can
achieve comparable performance to the global fidelity quantum kernel. Our work
unifies existing quantum kernels and provides a systematic framework to compare
their properties.

**Hybrid III-V/Silicon photonic circuits embedding generation and routing of entangled photon pairs**—2023-11-21 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12718v2)]<br/>J. Schuhmann, L. Lazzari, M. Morassi, A. Lemaitre, I. Sagnes, G. Beaudoin, M. I. Amanti, F. Boeuf, F. Raineri, F. Baboux, S. Ducci
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The demand for integrated photonic chips combining the generation and
manipulation of quantum states of light is steadily increasing, driven by the
need for compact and scalable platforms for quantum information technologies.
While photonic circuits with diverse functionalities are being developed in
different single material platforms, it has become crucial to realize hybrid
photonic circuits that harness the advantages of multiple materials while
mitigating their respective weaknesses, resulting in enhanced capabilities.
Here, we demonstrate a hybrid III-V/Silicon quantum photonic device combining
the strong second-order nonlinearity and compliance with electrical pumping of
the III-V semiconductor platform with the high maturity and CMOS compatibility
of the silicon photonic platform. Our device embeds the spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) of photon pairs into an AlGaAs source and their
subsequent routing to a silicon-on-insulator circuitry, within an evanescent
coupling scheme managing both polarization states. This enables the on-chip
generation of broadband telecom photons by type 0 and type 2 SPDC from the
hybrid device, at room temperature and with internal pair generation rates
exceeding $10^5$ $s^{-1}$ for both types, while the pump beam is strongly
rejected. Two-photon interference with 92% visibility (and up to 99% upon 5 nm
spectral filtering) proves the high energy-time entanglement quality
characterizing the produced quantum state, thereby enabling a wide range of
quantum information applications on-chip, within an hybrid architecture merging
the assets of two mature and highly complementary platforms in view of
out-of-the-lab deployment of quantum technologies.

**Enigma: Privacy-Preserving Execution of QAOA on Untrusted Quantum Computers**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13546v1)]<br/>Ramin Ayanzadeh, Ahmad Mousavi, Narges Alavisamani, Moinuddin Qureshi
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum computers can solve problems that are beyond the capabilities of
conventional computers. As quantum computers are expensive and hard to
maintain, the typical model for performing quantum computation is to send the
circuit to a quantum cloud provider. This leads to privacy concerns for
commercial entities as an untrusted server can learn protected information from
the provided circuit. Current proposals for Secure Quantum Computing (SQC)
either rely on emerging technologies (such as quantum networks) or incur
prohibitive overheads (for Quantum Homomorphic Encryption). The goal of our
paper is to enable low-cost privacy-preserving quantum computation that can be
used with current systems.
  We propose Enigma, a suite of privacy-preserving schemes specifically
designed for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Unlike
previous SQC techniques that obfuscate quantum circuits, Enigma transforms the
input problem of QAOA, such that the resulting circuit and the outcomes are
unintelligible to the server. We introduce three variants of Enigma. Enigma-I
protects the coefficients of QAOA using random phase flipping and fudging of
values. Enigma-II protects the nodes of the graph by introducing decoy qubits,
which are indistinguishable from primary ones. Enigma-III protects the edge
information of the graph by modifying the graph such that each node has an
identical number of connections. For all variants of Enigma, we demonstrate
that we can still obtain the solution for the original problem. We evaluate
Enigma using IBM quantum devices and show that the privacy improvements of
Enigma come at only a small reduction in fidelity (1%-13%).

**Anomalous second-order skin modes in Floquet non-Hermitian systems**—2023-03-20 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11259v2)]<br/>Chun-Hui Liu, Haiping Hu, Shu Chen, Xiong-Jun Liu
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The non-Hermitian skin effect under open boundary conditions is widely
believed to originate from the intrinsic spectral topology under periodic
boundary conditions. If the eigenspectra under periodic boundary conditions
have no spectral windings (e.g., piecewise arcs) or a finite area on the
complex plane, there will be no non-Hermitian skin effect with open boundaries.
In this article, we demonstrate another scenario beyond this perception by
introducing a two-dimensional periodically driven model. The effective Floquet
Hamiltonian lacks intrinsic spectral topology and is proportional to the
identity matrix (representing a single point on the complex plane) under
periodic boundary conditions. Yet, the Floquet Hamiltonian exhibits a
second-order skin effect that is robust against perturbations and disorder
under open boundary conditions. We further reveal the dynamical origin of these
second-order skin modes and illustrate that they are characterized by a
dynamical topological invariant of the full time-evolution operator.

**Finding eigenvectors with a quantum variational algorithm**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13543v1)]<br/>Juan Carlos Garcia-Escartin
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  This paper presents a hybrid variational quantum algorithm that finds a
random eigenvector of a unitary matrix with a known quantum circuit. The
algorithm is based on the SWAP test on trial states generated by a parametrized
quantum circuit. The eigenvector is described by a compact set of classical
parameters that can be used to reproduce the found approximation to the
eigenstate on demand. This variational eigenvector finder can be adapted to
solve the generalized eigenvalue problem, to find the eigenvectors of normal
matrices and to perform quantum principal component analysis (QPCA) on unknown
input mixed states. These algorithms can all be run with low depth quantum
circuits, suitable for an efficient implementation on noisy intermediate state
quantum computers (NISQC) and, with some restrictions, on linear optical
systems. Limitations and potential applications are discussed.

**Limiting flux in quantum thermodynamics**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13536v1)]<br/>Domingos S. P. Salazar
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In quantum systems, entropy production is typically defined as the quantum
relative entropy between two states. This definition provides an upper bound
for any flux (of particles, energy, entropy, etc.) of bounded observables,
which proves especially useful near equilibrium. However, this bound tends to
be irrelevant in general nonequilibrium situations. We propose a new upper
bound for such fluxes in terms of quantum relative entropy, applicable even far
from equilibrium and in the strong coupling regime. Additionally, we compare
this bound with Monte Carlo simulations of random qubits with coherence, as
well as with a model of two interacting nuclear spins.

**The mass of simple and higher-order networks**—2023-09-14 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07851v3)]<br/>Ginestra Bianconi
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We propose a theoretical framework that explains how the mass of simple and
higher-order networks emerges from their topology and geometry. We use the
discrete topological Dirac operator to define an action for a massless
self-interacting topological Dirac field inspired by the Nambu-Jona Lasinio
model. The mass of the network is strictly speaking the mass of this
topological Dirac field defined on the network; it results from the chiral
symmetry breaking of the model and satisfies a self-consistent gap equation.
Interestingly, it is shown that the mass of a network depends on its spectral
properties, topology, and geometry. Due to the breaking of the
matter-antimatter symmetry observed for the harmonic modes of the discrete
topological Dirac operator, two possible definitions of the network mass can be
given. For both possible definitions, the mass of the network comes from a gap
equation with the difference among the two definitions encoded in the value of
the bare mass. Indeed, the bare mass can be determined either by the Betti
number $\beta_0$ or by the Betti number $\beta_1$ of the network. We provide
numerical results on the mass of different networks, including random graphs,
scale-free, and real weighted collaboration networks. We also discuss the
generalization of these results to higher-order networks, defining the mass of
simplicial complexes. The observed dependence of the mass of the considered
topological Dirac field with the topology and geometry of the network could
lead to interesting physics in the scenario in which the considered Dirac field
is coupled with a dynamical evolution of the underlying network structure.

**Improvements on Device Independent and Semi-Device Independent Protocols of Randomness Expansion**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13528v1)]<br/>Rutvij Bhavsar
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  To generate genuine random numbers, random number generators based on quantum
theory are essential. However, ensuring that the process used to produce
randomness meets desired security standards can pose challenges for traditional
quantum random number generators. This thesis delves into Device Independent
(DI) and Semi-Device Independent (semi-DI) protocols of randomness expansion,
based on a minimal set of experimentally verifiable security assumptions. The
security in DI protocols relies on the violation of Bell inequalities, which
certify the quantum behavior of devices. The semi-DI protocols discussed in
this thesis require the characterization of only one device - a power meter.
These protocols exploit the fact that quantum states can be prepared such that
they cannot be distinguished with certainty, thereby creating a randomness
resource. In this study, we introduce enhanced DI and semi-DI protocols that
surpass existing ones in terms of output randomness rate, security, or in some
instances, both. Our analysis employs the Entropy Accumulation Theorem (EAT) to
determine the extractable randomness for finite rounds. A notable contribution
is the introduction of randomness expansion protocols that recycle input
randomness, significantly enhancing finite round randomness rates for DI
protocols based on the CHSH inequality violation. In the final section of the
thesis, we delve into Generalized Probability Theories (GPTs), with a focus on
Boxworld, the largest GPT capable of producing correlations consistent with
relativity. A tractable criterion for identifying a Boxworld channel is
presented.

**Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory with Continuous Normalizing Flows**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13518v1)]<br/>Alexandre de Camargo, Ricky T. Q. Chen, Rodrigo A. Vargas-Hernández
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) provides an alternative
approach for calculating the molecular electronic energy, relying solely on the
electron density. In OF-DFT, both the ground-state density is optimized
variationally to minimize the total energy functional while satisfying the
normalization constraint. In this work, we introduce a novel approach by
parameterizing the electronic density with a normalizing flow ansatz, which is
also optimized by minimizing the total energy functional. Our model
successfully replicates the electronic density for a diverse range of chemical
systems, including a one-dimensional diatomic molecule, specifically Lithium
hydride with varying interatomic distances, as well as comprehensive
simulations of hydrogen and water molecules, all conducted in Cartesian space.

**Photon Number Resolving Detection with a Single-Photon Detector and Adaptive Storage Loop**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13515v1)]<br/>Nicholas M. Sullivan, Boris Braverman, Jeremy Upham, Robert W. Boyd
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Photon number resolving (PNR) measurements are beneficial or even necessary
for many applications in quantum optics. Unfortunately, PNR detectors are
usually large, slow, expensive, and difficult to operate. However, if the input
signal is multiplexed, photon "click" detectors, that lack an intrinsic photon
number resolving capability, can still be used to realize photon number
resolution. Here, we investigate the operation of a single click detector,
together with a storage line with tunable outcoupling. Using adaptive feedback
to adjust the storage outcoupling rate, the dynamic range of the detector can
in certain situations be extended by up to an order of magnitude relative to a
purely passive setup. An adaptive approach can thus allow for photon number
variance below the quantum shot noise limit under a wider range of conditions
than using a passive multiplexing approach. This can enable applications in
quantum enhanced metrology and quantum computing.

**Quantum Sensing of Magnetic Fields with Molecular Spins**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13504v1)]<br/>Claudio Bonizzoni, Alberto Ghirri, Fabio Santanni, Marco Affronte
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Spins are prototypical systems with the potential to probe magnetic fields
down to the atomic scale limit. Exploiting their quantum nature through
appropriate sensing protocols allows to enlarge their applicability to fields
not always accessible by classical sensors. Here we first show that quantum
sensing protocols for AC magnetic fields can be implemented on molecular spin
ensembles embedded into hybrid quantum circuits. We then show that, using only
echo detection at microwave frequency and no optical readout, Dynamical
Decoupling protocols synchronized with the AC magnetic fields can enhance the
sensitivity up to $S = 10^{-10}-10^{-9}T/\sqrt{Hz}$ with a low (4-5) number of
applied pulses. These results paves the way for the development of strategies
to exploit molecular spins as quantum sensors.

**Non-Gaussian correlations in the steady-state of driven-dissipative clouds of two-level atoms**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13503v1)]<br/>Giovanni Ferioli, Sara Pancaldi, Antoine Glicenstein, David Clement, Antoine Browaeys, Igor Ferrier-Barbut
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We report experimental measurements of the second-order coherence function
$g^{(2)}(\tau)$ of the light emitted by a laser-driven dense ensemble of
$^{87}$Rb atoms. We observe a clear departure from the Siegert relation valid
for Gaussian chaotic light. Measuring intensity and first-order coherence, we
conclude that the violation is not due to the emergence of a coherent field.
This indicates that the light obeys non-Gaussian statistics, stemming from
non-Gaussian correlations in the atomic medium. More specifically, the
steady-state of this driven-dissipative many-body system sustains high-order
correlations in the absence of first-order coherence. These findings call for
new theoretical and experimental explorations to uncover their origin and they
open new perspectives for the realization of non-Gaussian states of light.

**Distribution of Telecom Time-Bin Entangled Photons through a 7.7 km Antiresonant Hollow-Core Fiber**—2023-08-02 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01337v2)]<br/>Michael Antesberger, Carla M. D. Richter, Francesco Poletti, Radan Slavík, Periklis Petropoulos, Hannes Hübel, Alessandro Trenti, Philip Walther, Lee A. Rozema
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  State of the art classical and quantum communication rely on standard optical
fibers with solid cores to transmit light over long distances. However, recent
advances have led to the emergence of antiresonant hollow-core optical fibers
(AR-HCFs), which due to the novel fiber geometry, show remarkable optical
guiding properties, which are not as limited by the material properties as
solid-core fibers. In this paper, we explore the transmission of entangled
photons through a novel 7.7 km AR-HCF, presenting the first successful
demonstration of entanglement distribution via long-distance AR-HCF. In
addition to showing these novel fibers are compatible with long distance
quantum communication, we highlight the low latency and low chromatic
dispersion intrinsic to AR-HCF, which can increase the secure key rate in
time-bin based quantum key distribution protocols.

**Optimal optomechanical cavity setups with highly reflecting membranes**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13499v1)]<br/>Georg Enzian, Eugene S. Polzik, Alexander K. Tagantsev
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Highly reflecting mechanically compliant membranes based on photonic-crystal
patterns have recently gained increasing attention within cavity optomechanics
due to their prospects of reaching high coupling rates in
membrane-in-the-middle experiments. Here we present an analysis and comparison
of four different setups in which highly reflecting membranes can be employed
for cavity optomechanics, and discuss optimal choices w.r.t. the figures of
merit cooperativity and efficiency-weighted cooperativity. The analysis
encompasses three different types of membrane-in-the-middle setups
(membrane-at-the-edge, membrane-in-the-actual-middle, and
membrane-at-the-back), as well as the simple Fabry-Perot cavity. Interestingly,
we identify and propose the membrane-at-the-back setup as an optimal choice in
the limit of negligible membrane parasitic loss, which can reach enormous
enhancements of optomechanical cooperativity, and if implemented with a
low-loss membrane would pave the way to nonlinear optomechanics in the quantum
regime.

**Projective toric designs, difference sets, and quantum state designs**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13479v1)]<br/>Joseph T. Iosue, T. C. Mooney, Adam Ehrenberg, Alexey V. Gorshkov
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Trigonometric cubature rules of degree $t$ are sets of points on the torus
over which sums reproduce integrals of degree $t$ monomials over the full
torus. They can be thought of as $t$-designs on the torus. Motivated by the
projective structure of quantum mechanics, we develop the notion of $t$-designs
on the projective torus, which, surprisingly, have a much more restricted
structure than their counterparts on full tori. We provide various
constructions of these projective toric designs and prove some bounds on their
size and characterizations of their structure. We draw connections between
projective toric designs and a diverse set of mathematical objects, including
difference and Sidon sets from the field of additive combinatorics, symmetric,
informationally complete positive operator valued measures (SIC-POVMs) and
complete sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) (which are conjectured to
relate to finite projective geometry) from quantum information theory, and
crystal ball sequences of certain root lattices. Using these connections, we
prove bounds on the maximal size of dense $B_t \bmod m$ sets. We also use
projective toric designs to construct families of quantum state designs.
Finally, we discuss many open questions about the properties of these
projective toric designs and how they relate to other questions in number
theory, geometry, and quantum information.

**Alternative robust ways of witnessing nonclassicality in the simplest scenario**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13474v1)]<br/>Massy Khoshbin, Lorenzo Catani, Matthew Leifer
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this work we relate notions of nonclassicality in the simplest nontrivial
scenario (a prepare and measure scenario composed of four preparations and two
binary-outcome tomographically complete measurements). Specifically, we relate
the established method developed in [Pusey, PRA 98,022112(2018)] to witness a
violation of preparation noncontextuality, that is not suitable in experiments
where the operational equivalences to be tested are specified in advance, with
a novel approach based on the notion of bounded ontological distinctness for
preparations, defined in [Chaturvedi and Saha, Quantum 4, 345 (2020)]. In our
approach, we test bounded ontological distinctness for two particular
preparations that are relevant in certain information processing tasks in that
they are associated with the even and odd parity of the bits to communicate.
When there exists an ontological model where this distance is preserved we talk
of parity preservation. Our main result provides a noise threshold under which
violating parity preservation (and so bounded ontological distinctness) agrees
with the established method for witnessing preparation contextuality in the
simplest nontrivial scenario. This is achieved by first relating the violation
of parity preservation to the quantification of contextuality in terms of
inaccessible information as developed in [Marvian, arXiv:2003.05984(2020)],
that we also show, given the way we quantify noise, to be more robust in
witnessing contextuality than Pusey's noncontextuality inequality. As an
application of our findings, we treat the case of 2 bit parity-oblivious
multiplexing in the presence of noise. In particular, we provide a condition
for which the result establishing preparation contextuality as a resource for
the quantum advantage of the protocol in the noiseless case still holds in the
noisy case.

**Non-Gaussian Quantum Illumination with three modes**—2023-05-17 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10458v4)]<br/>Ricardo Gallego Torromé
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  It is shown that quantum illumination with three modes non-Gaussian states,
where the signal states describes two modes photons state and the idler is
described one photon mode state, can outperform in sensitivity standard
Gaussian quantum illumination in a high noisy background. In particular, there
is a reduction in the probability due to an increase in the probability of
error exponent by a factor $2/\sqrt{N_S}$, where $N_S$ is the average number of
photons per mode of the signal state.

**State Diagrams to determine Tree Tensor Network Operators**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13433v1)]<br/>Richard M. Milbradt, Qunsheng Huang, Christian B. Mendl
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  This work is concerned with tree tensor network operators (TTNOs) for
representing quantum Hamiltonians. We first establish a mathematical framework
connecting tree topologies with state diagrams. Based on these, we devise an
algorithm for constructing a TTNO given a Hamiltonian. The algorithm exploits
the tensor product structure of the Hamiltonian to add paths to a state
diagram, while combining local operators if possible. We test the capabilities
of our algorithm on random Hamiltonians for a given tree structure.
Additionally, we construct explicit TTNOs for nearest neighbour interactions on
a tree topology. Furthermore, we derive a bound on the bond dimension of tensor
operators representing arbitrary interactions on trees. Finally, we consider an
open quantum system in the form of a Heisenberg spin chain coupled to bosonic
bath sites as a concrete example. We find that tree structures allow for lower
bond dimensions of the Hamiltonian tensor network representation compared to a
matrix product operator structure. This reduction is large enough to reduce the
number of total tensor elements required as soon as the number of baths per
spin reaches $3$.

**Casimir force in discrete scalar fields I: 1D and 2D cases**—2023-06-26 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00624v2)]<br/>Eduardo Flores, Christian Ireland, Nabil Jamhour, Victor Lasasso, Nicholas Kurth, Matthew Leinbach
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We calculate the Casimir force between parallel plates for a massless scalar
field. When adding the energy of normal modes, we avoid infinities by using a
discrete spacetime lattice; however, this approach proves ineffective as long
as both space and time are kept discrete. Yet, when time is treated as
continuous while the scalar field forms a spatial periodic lattice, our method
succeeds, and we refer to this approach as Hamiltonian lattice theory. The
dispersion relation for both square and triangular lattices accurately
reproduces the subtle Casimir effect, providing evidence that the Casimir force
is independent of the type of lattice used. At low frequencies, both lattices
exhibit a high level of rotational symmetry. However, at high frequencies, they
lose this symmetry, even though the propagation of high-frequency waves becomes
limited as their group velocity approaches zero.

**Fault-tolerant measurement-free quantum error correction with multi-qubit gates**—2020-07-19 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09804v4)]<br/>Michael A. Perlin, Vickram N. Premakumar, Jiakai Wang, Mark Saffman, Robert Joynt
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Measurement-free quantum error correction (MFQEC) offers an alternative to
standard measurement-based QEC in platforms with an unconditional qubit reset
gate. We revisit the question of fault tolerance (FT) for a measurement-free
variant of the Steane code that leverages multi-qubit gates and redundant
syndrome extraction, finding previously overlooked phase-flip errors that
undermine FT. We then construct a revised MFQEC circuit that is resistant to
all single-qubit errors, but which nonetheless cannot tolerate certain
correlated errors. In order to investigate FT systematically, we introduce an
efficient method to classically simulate MFQEC circuits with (i) Clifford gates
for syndrome extraction, (ii) syndrome-controlled Pauli operations for
decoding, and (iii) a Pauli noise model. We thereby find a pseudothreshold of
$\sim0.7\%$ for our revised MFQEC Steane code under a restricted noise model
previously considered in the literature. We then relax noise model assumptions
to identify general requirements for FT with multi-qubit gates, finding that
existing multi-qubit neutral atom gates are incompatible with fault-tolerant
syndrome extraction in a straightforward implementation of both
measurement-based and measurement-free variants of the Steane code. Decomposing
multi-qubit gates into two-qubit gates similarly spoils FT. Finally, we discuss
the theoretical ingredients that are necessary to recover FT for MFQEC codes,
including single-shot FT and a recent proposal by Heu{\ss}en \textit{et
al.}~[arXiv:2307.13296] to achieve FT by ``copying'' errors onto an ancilla
register. By combining multi-qubit gates, redundant syndrome extraction, and
copy-assisted FT, we construct a measurement-free and fault-tolerant variant of
the Steane code with a pseudothreshold of $\sim0.1\%$.

**Coupling undetected sensing modes by quantum erasure**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13421v1)]<br/>Nathan R. Gemmell, Yue Ma, Emma Pearce, Jefferson Florez, Olaf Czerwinski, M. S. Kim, Rupert F. Oulton, Alex S. Clark, Chris C. Phillips
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The effect known as ``induced coherence without induced emission'' has
spawned a field dedicated to imaging with undetected photons (IUP), where
photons from two distinct photon-pair sources interfere if their outputs are
made indistinguishable. The indistinguishability is commonly achieved in two
setups. Induced coherence IUP (IC-IUP) has only the idler photons from the
first source passing through the second, whilst nonlinear interferometry
(NI-IUP) has both signal and idler photons from the first source passing
through the second and can be simpler to implement. In both cases, changes in
the idler path between sources can be detected by measuring the interference
fringes in the signal path in a way that allows image information to be moved
between different wavelengths. Here we model and implement a novel setup that
uses a polarization state quantum eraser approach to move continuously between
IC-IUP and NI-IUP operation. We find excellent agreement between experiment and
theory in the low-gain or quantum regime. The system also provides a new route
for optimizing IUP interference by using controllable quantum erasure to
balance the interferometer.

**Zig-zag dynamics in a Stern-Gerlach spin measurement**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13406v1)]<br/>Simon Krekels, Christian Maes, Kasper Meerts, Ward Struyve
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The one-century-old Stern-Gerlach setup is paradigmatic for a quantum
measurement. We visualize the electron trajectories following the Bohmian
zig-zag dynamics. This dynamics was developed in order to deal with the
fundamentally massless nature of particles (with mass emerging from the
Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism). The corresponding trajectories exhibit a
stochastic zig-zagging, as the result of the coupling between left- and
right-handed chiral Weyl states. This zig-zagging persists in the
non-relativistic limit, which will be considered here, and which is described
the Pauli equation for a nonuniform external magnetic field. Our results
clarify the different meanings of "spin" as a property of the wave function and
as a random variable in the Stern-Gerlach setup, and they illustrate the notion
of effective collapse. We also examine the case of an EPR-pair. By letting one
of the entangled particles pass through a Stern-Gerlach device, the nonlocal
influence (action-at-a-distance) on the other particle is manifest in its
trajectory, e.g. by initiating its zig-zagging.

**Introducing Reduced-Width QNNs, an AI-inspired Ansatz Design Pattern**—2023-06-08 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05047v2)]<br/>Jonas Stein, Tobias Rohe, Francesco Nappi, Julian Hager, David Bucher, Maximilian Zorn, Michael Kölle, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Variational Quantum Algorithms are one of the most promising candidates to
yield the first industrially relevant quantum advantage. Being capable of
arbitrary function approximation, they are often referred to as Quantum Neural
Networks (QNNs) when being used in analog settings as classical Artificial
Neural Networks (ANNs). Similar to the early stages of classical machine
learning, known schemes for efficient architectures of these networks are
scarce. Exploring beyond existing design patterns, we propose a reduced-width
circuit ansatz design, which is motivated by recent results gained in the
analysis of dropout regularization in QNNs. More precisely, this exploits the
insight, that the gates of overparameterized QNNs can be pruned substantially
until their expressibility decreases. The results of our case study show, that
the proposed design pattern can significantly reduce training time while
maintaining the same result quality as the standard "full-width" design in the
presence of noise.

**Extracting Many-Body Quantum Resources within One-Body Reduced Density Matrix Functional Theory**—2023-11-21 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12596v2)]<br/>Carlos L. Benavides-Riveros, Tomasz Wasak, Alessio Recati
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a central concept in quantum sciences
used to quantify the ultimate precision limit of parameter estimation, detect
quantum phase transitions, witness genuine multipartite entanglement, or probe
nonlocality. Despite this widespread range of applications, computing the QFI
value of quantum many-body systems is, in general, a very demanding task. Here
we combine ideas from functional theories and quantum information to develop a
novel functional framework for the QFI of fermionic and bosonic ground states.
By relying upon the constrained-search approach, we demonstrate that the QFI
matricial values can universally be determined by the one-body reduced density
matrix (1-RDM), avoiding thus the use of exponentially large wave functions.
Furthermore, we show that QFI functionals can be determined from the universal
1-RDM functional by calculating its derivatives with respect to the coupling
strengths, becoming thus the generating functional of the QFI. We showcase our
approach with the Bose-Hubbard model and present exact analytical and numerical
QFI functionals. Our results provide the first connection between the one-body
reduced density matrix functional theory and the quantum Fisher information.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We investigate network nonlocality in the triangle scenario when all three
parties have no input and binary outputs. Through an explicit example, we prove
that this minimal scenario supports nonlocal correlations compatible with
no-signaling and independence of the three sources, but not with realisations
based on independent quantum or classical sources. This nonlocality is robust
to noise. Moreover, we identify the equivalent to a Popescu-Rohrlich box in the
minimal triangle scenario.

obscure aspects of Bohr's approach to quantum theory, as well as a seemingly

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two remote users to share a common
information-theoretic secure secret key. In order to guarantee the security of
a practical QKD implementation, the physical system has to be fully
characterized and all deviations from the ideal protocol due to various
imperfections of realistic devices have to be taken into account in the
security proof. In this work, we study the security of the efficient
decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol in the presence of source flaws, caused by
imperfect intensity and polarization modulation. We investigate the
non-Poissonian photon-number statistics due to coherent-state intensity
fluctuations and the basis-dependence of the source due to non-ideal
polarization state preparation. The analysis is supported by experimental
characterization of intensity and phase distributions.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The effectiveness of measurement-based feedback control (MBFC) protocols is
hampered by the presence of measurement noise, which affects the ability to
accurately infer the underlying dynamics of a quantum system from noisy
continuous measurement records to determine an accurate control strategy. To
circumvent such limitations, this work explores a real-time stochastic state
estimation approach that enables noise-free monitoring of the conditional
dynamics including the full density matrix of the quantum system using noisy
measurement records within a single quantum trajectory -- a method we name as
`conditional state tomography'. This, in turn, enables the development of
precise MBFC strategies that lead to effective control of quantum systems by
essentially mitigating the constraints imposed by measurement noise and has
potential applications in various feedback quantum control scenarios. This
approach is particularly useful for reinforcement-learning (RL)-based control,
where the RL-agent can be trained with arbitrary conditional averages of
observables, and/or the full density matrix as input (observation), to quickly
and accurately learn control strategies.

  Going as far as possible at SAT problem solving is the main aim of our work.
For this sake we have made use of quantum computing from its two, on practice,

both techniques. This paper presents and describes a hybrid quantum computing
strategy for solving 3-SAT problems. The performance of this approximation has
been tested over a set of representative scenarios when dealing with 3-SAT from

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Utilizing the framework of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories in the
context of Pauli stabilizer codes, we present methodologies for simulating
fermions via qubit systems on a two-dimensional square lattice. We investigate
the symplectic automorphisms of the Pauli module over the Laurent polynomial
ring. This enables us to systematically increase the code distances of
stabilizer codes while fixing the rate between encoded logical fermions and
physical qubits. We identify a family of stabilizer codes suitable for fermion
simulation, achieving code distances of $d=2,3,4,5,6,7$, allowing correction of
any $\lfloor \frac{d-1}{2} \rfloor$-qubit error. In contrast to the traditional
code concatenation approach, our method can increase the code distances without
decreasing the (fermionic) code rate. In particular, we explicitly show all
stabilizers and logical operators for codes with code distances of $d=3,4,5$.
We provide syndromes for all Pauli errors and invent a syndrome-matching
algorithm to compute code distances numerically.

**Towards the Intuitive Understanding of Quantum World: Sonification of Rabi Oscillations, Wigner functions, and Quantum Simulators**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13313v1)]<br/>Reiko Yamada, Eloy Piñol, Samuele Grandi, Jakub Zakrzewski, Maciej Lewenstein
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Recently, there has been considerable interest in "sonifying" scientific
data; however, sonifying quantum processes using the newest quantum
technologies, including Noise Intermediate Scale Quantum devices and quantum
random number generators, is still an emerging area of research. Music
technologists and composers employ the growing accessibility to diverse data
from quantum mechanics as musical tools in the hope of generating new sound
expressions. How different is the quantum world from the classical one, and is
it possible to express the quantum world using sounds? Quantum phenomena are
very different from those that we experience in our everyday lives. Thus, it is
challenging to understand them intuitively. In this paper, we propose
sonification as a method toward an intuitive understanding of various quantum
mechanical phenomena, from Rabi oscillations and resonance fluorescence of a
single atom through the generation of Schr\"odinger cat states in strong laser
field physics to insulator-superfluid transition in quantum many-body systems.
This paper illustrates various methods we experimented with in sonification and
score representations of quantum data depending on the source data and
performance settings.

**Weak universality, quantum many-body scars and anomalous infinite-temperature autocorrelations in a one-dimensional spin model with duality**—2023-07-20 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11161v3)]<br/>Adithi Udupa, Samudra Sur, Sourav Nandy, Arnab Sen, Diptiman Sen
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We study a one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ model with three-spin interactions and
a transverse magnetic field $h$. The model has a $Z_2 \times Z_2$ symmetry, and
a duality between $h$ and $1/h$. The self-dual point at $h=1$ is a quantum
critical point with a continuous phase transition. We compute the critical
exponents $z$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\nu$, and the central charge $c$
numerically using exact diagonalization (ED) for systems with periodic boundary
conditions. We find that both $z$ and $c$ are equal to $1$, implying that the
critical point is governed by a conformal field theory. The values obtained for
$\beta/\nu$, $\gamma/\nu$, and $\nu$ from ED suggest that the model exhibits
Ashkin-Teller criticality with an effective coupling that is intermediate
between the four-state Potts model and two decoupled transverse field Ising
models. An analysis on larger systems but with open boundaries using
density-matrix renormalization group calculations, however, shows that the
self-dual point may be in the same universality class as the four-state Potts
model. An energy level spacing analysis shows that the model is not integrable.
For a system with periodic boundary conditions, there are an exponentially
large number of exact mid-spectrum zero-energy eigenstates. A subset of these
eigenstates have wave functions which are independent of $h$ and have unusual
entanglement structure, suggesting that they are quantum many-body scars. The
number of such states scales at least linearly with system size. Finally, we
study the infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions close to one end of an
open system. We find that some of the autocorrelators relax anomalously in
time, with pronounced oscillations and very small decay rates if $h \gg 1$ or
$h \ll 1$. If $h$ is close to the critical point, the autocorrelators decay
quickly to zero except for an autocorrelator at the end site.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  One of the simplest possible quantum circuits, consisting of a CNOT gate, a
Hadamard gate and a measurement on one of the outputs is known to lead to
chaotic dynamics when applied iteratively on an ensemble of equally prepared
qubits. The evolution of pure initial quantum states is characterized by a
fractal (in the space of states), formed by the border of different convergence
regions. We examine how the ideal evolution is distorted in the presence of
both coherent error and incoherent initial noise, which are typical
imperfections in current implementations of quantum computers. It is known that
under the influence of initial noise only, the fractal is preserved, moreover,
its dimension remains constant below a critical noise level. We systematically
analyze the effect of coherent Hadamard gate errors by determining fixed points
and cycles of the evolution. We combine analytic and numerical methods to
explore to what extent the dynamics is altered by coherent errors in the
presence of preparation noise as well. We show that the main features of the
dynamics, and especially the fractal borders, are robust against the discussed
noise, they will only be slightly distorted. We identify a range of error
parameters, for which the characteristic properties of the dynamics are not
significantly altered. Hence, our results allow to identify reliable regimes of
operation of iterative protocols.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  DPPs were introduced by Macchi as a model in quantum optics the 1970s. Since
then, they have been widely used as models and subsampling tools in statistics
and computer science. Most applications require sampling from a DPP, and given
their quantum origin, it is natural to wonder whether sampling a DPP on a
quantum computer is easier than on a classical one. We focus here on DPPs over
a finite state space, which are distributions over the subsets of
$\{1,\dots,N\}$ parametrized by an $N\times N$ Hermitian kernel matrix. Vanilla
sampling consists in two steps, of respective costs $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(Nr^2)$ operations on a classical computer, where $r$ is the rank
of the kernel matrix. A large first part of the current paper consists in
explaining why the state-of-the-art in quantum simulation of fermionic systems
already yields quantum DPP sampling algorithms. We then modify existing quantum
circuits, and discuss their insertion in a full DPP sampling pipeline that
starts from practical kernel specifications. The bottom line is that, with $P$
(classical) parallel processors, we can divide the preprocessing cost by $P$
and build a quantum circuit with $\mathcal{O}(Nr)$ gates that sample a given
DPP, with depth varying from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r\log N)$
depending on qubit-communication constraints on the target machine. We also
connect existing work on the simulation of superconductors to Pfaffian point
processes, which generalize DPPs and would be a natural addition to the machine
learner's toolbox. In particular, we describe "projective" Pfaffian point
processes, the cardinality of which has constant parity, almost surely.
Finally, the circuits are empirically validated on a classical simulator and on
5-qubit IBM machines.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Byzantine agreement, the underlying core of blockchain, aims to make every
node in a decentralized network reach consensus. Classical Byzantine agreements
unavoidably face two major problems. One is $1/3$ fault-tolerance bound, which
means that the system to tolerate $f$ malicious players requires at least
$3f+1$ players. The other is the security loopholes from its classical
cryptography methods. Here, we propose a Byzantine agreement framework with
unconditional security to break this bound with nearly $1/2$ fault tolerance
due to multiparty correlation provided by quantum digital signatures.
\textcolor{black}{It is intriguing that quantum entanglement is not necessary
to break the $1/3$ fault-tolerance bound, and we show that weaker correlation,
such as asymmetric relationship of quantum digital signature, can also work.}
Our work strictly obeys two Byzantine conditions and can be extended to any
number of players without requirements for multiparticle entanglement. We
experimentally demonstrate three-party and five-party consensus for a digital
ledger. Our work indicates the quantum advantage in terms of consensus problems
and suggests an important avenue for quantum blockchain and quantum consensus
networks.

**Alleviating Barren Plateaus in Parameterized Quantum Machine Learning Circuits: Investigating Advanced Parameter Initialization Strategies**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13218v1)]<br/>Muhammad Kashif, Muhammad Rashid, Saif Al-Kuwari, Muhammad Shafique
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have emerged as a foundational element
in the development and applications of quantum algorithms. However, when
initialized with random parameter values, PQCs often exhibit barren plateaus
(BP). These plateaus, characterized by vanishing gradients with an increasing
number of qubits, hinder optimization in quantum algorithms. In this paper, we
analyze the impact of state-of-the-art parameter initialization strategies from
classical machine learning in random PQCs from the aspect of BP phenomenon. Our
investigation encompasses a spectrum of initialization techniques, including
random, Xavier (both normal and uniform variants), He, LeCun, and Orthogonal
methods. Empirical assessment reveals a pronounced reduction in variance decay
of gradients across all these methodologies compared to the randomly
initialized PQCs. Specifically, the Xavier initialization technique outperforms
the rest, showing a 62\% improvement in variance decay compared to the random
initialization. The He, Lecun, and orthogonal methods also display
improvements, with respective enhancements of 32\%, 28\%, and 26\%. This
compellingly suggests that the adoption of these existing initialization
techniques holds the potential to significantly amplify the training efficacy
of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), a subclass of PQCs. Demonstrating this
effect, we employ the identified techniques to train QNNs for learning the
identity function, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of BPs. The
training performance, ranked from the best to the worst, aligns with the
variance decay enhancement as outlined above. This paper underscores the role
of tailored parameter initialization in mitigating the BP problem and
eventually enhancing the training dynamics of QNNs.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this paper, we present holographic descriptions of entanglement phase
transition using AdS/BCFT. First, we analytically calculate the holographic
pseudo entropy in the AdS/BCFT model with a brane localized scalar field and
show the entanglement phase transition behavior where the time evolution of
entropy changes from the linear growth to the trivial one via a critical
logarithmic evolution. In this model, the imaginary valued scalar field
localized on the brane controls the phase transition, which is analogous to the
amount of projections in the measurement induced phase transition. Next, we
study the AdS/BCFT model with a brane localized gauge field, where the phase
transition looks different in that there is no logarithmically evolving
critical point. Finally, we discuss a bulk analog of the above model by
considering a double Wick rotation of the Janus solution. We compute the
holographic pseudo entropy in this model and show that the entropy grows
logarithmically.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  It is a key issue to characterize the model of standard quantum theory out of
general models by an operational condition. The framework of General
Probabilistic Theories (GPTs) is a new information theoretical approach to
single out standard quantum theory. It is known that traditional properties,
for example, Bell-CHSH inequality are not sufficient to single out standard
quantum theory among possible models in GPTs. As a more precise property, we
focus on the bound of the performance for an information task called state
discrimination in general models. We give an equivalent condition for
outperforming the minimum discrimination error probability under the standard
quantum theory, which is given by the trace norm. Besides, by applying the
equivalent condition, we characterize standard quantum theory out of general
models in GPTs by the bound of the performance for state discrimination.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this work, we investigate the semiclassical limit of a simple bosonic
quantum many-body system exhibiting both integrable and chaotic behavior. A
classical Hamiltonian is derived using coherent states. The transition from
regularity to chaos in classical dynamics is visualized through Poincar\'e
sections. Classical trajectories in phase space closely resemble the
projections of the Husimi functions of eigenstates with similar energy, even in
chaotic cases. It is demonstrated that this correlation is more evident when
projecting the eigenstates onto the Fock states. The analysis is carried out at
a critical energy where the eigenstates are maximally delocalized in the Fock
basis. Despite the imperfect delocalization, its influence is present in the
classical quantum properties under investigation. The study systematically
establishes quantum-classical correspondence for a bosonic many-body system
with more than two wells, even within the chaotic region.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this work, we confront the challenge of controlling quantum systems that
are influenced by their environment, utilizing the theory of dynamical
invariants. Our strategy involves a reverse engineering method for formulating
control protocols like Shortcuts to Adiabaticity (STA), tailored to be
resilient against environmental noise and dissipation. This technique offers
two main advantages compared to other quantum control methods: firstly, it
incorporates the time-varying aspect of the dissipation factor in the master
equation, which arises from driving the system's Hamiltonian (the control
fields). Secondly, our method eliminates the need for iterative propagation of
the system state, a process that is typically resource-intensive. The efficacy
and practicality of our approach are demonstrated through the application to
two fundamental models: a two-level quantum system and a quantum harmonic
oscillator, each interacting with a thermal bath.

  We define a symbolic execution framework QSE for quantum programs by
integrating symbolic variables into quantum states and the outcomes of quantum
measurements. The soundness theorem of QSE is proved. We further introduce
symbolic stabilizer states, which facilitate the efficient analysis of quantum
error correction programs. Within the QSE framework, we can use symbolic
expressions to characterize the possible adversarial errors in quantum error
correction, providing a significant improvement over existing methods that rely
on sampling with simulators. We implement QSE with the support of symbolic
stabilizer states in a prototype tool named QuantumSE.jl. With experiments on
representative quantum error correction codes, including quantum repetition
codes, Kitaev's toric codes, and quantum Tanner codes, we demonstrate the
efficiency of QuantumSE.jl for debugging quantum error correction programs with

functionality for stabilizer circuits also outperforms the state-of-the-art
stabilizer simulator, Google's Stim, in the experiments.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  This paper proposes an efficient stabilizer circuit simulation algorithm that
only traverses the circuit forward once. We introduce phase symbolization into
stabilizer generators, which allows possible Pauli faults in the circuit to be
accumulated explicitly as symbolic expressions in the phases of stabilizer
generators. This way, the measurement outcomes are also symbolic expressions,
and we can sample them by substituting the symbolic variables with concrete
values, without traversing the circuit repeatedly. We show how to integrate
symbolic phases into the stabilizer tableau and maintain them efficiently using
bit-vector encoding. A new data layout of the stabilizer tableau in memory is
proposed, which improves the performance of our algorithm (and other stabilizer
simulation algorithms based on the stabilizer tableau). We implement our
algorithm and data layout in a Julia package named SymPhase.jl, and compare it
with Stim, the state-of-the-art simulator, on several benchmarks. We show that
SymPhase.jl has superior performance in terms of sampling time, which is
crucial for generating a large number of samples for further analysis.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Dephasing is a main noise mechanism that afflicts quantum information, it
reduces visibility, and destroys coherence and entanglement. Therefore, it must
be reduced, mitigated, and if possible corrected, to allow for the
demonstration of quantum advantage in any application of quantum technology,
from computing to sensing and communications. Here we discuss a hardware scheme
of error filtration to mitigate the effects of dephasing in optical quantum
metrology. The scheme uses only passive linear optics and ancillary vacuum
modes, and we do not need single-photon sources or entanglement. It exploits
constructive and destructive interference to partially cancel the detrimental
effects of statistically independent sources of dephasing. We apply this scheme
to preserve coherent states and to phase stabilize stellar interferometry, and
show that a significant improvement can be obtained by using only a few
ancillary modes.

**Quantum optimization of coherent chaotic systems: A case for buses of Kathmandu**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13119v1)]<br/>Kiran Adhikari, Aman Ganeju, Iva Kumari Lamichhane, Rohit Bhattarai, Manghang Limbu, Nishma Bhattarai, Christian Deppe
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this paper, we propose a novel quantum computing approach to solve the
real-world problem of optimizing transportation in bustling Kathmandu city. The
transportation system in Kathmandu is chaotic, with no central authority
controlling the transportation. We leverage this chaotic feature in our quantum
optimization procedure. The quantum chaos theory's Wigner-Dyson distribution
surfaced as the most effective bus spacing distribution for a bus driver to
maximize their profit. We investigate the statistical properties of the buses
with real-time GPS bus location data and optimize bus spacing and interval
distribution around the 27 km circular ring road in Kathmandu. Using tools like
quantum simulation, eigenvalue distributions, and output wave function
analysis, we show that such optimal bus spacing distribution could be achieved.

**Powerful Quantum Circuit Resizing with Resource Efficient Synthesis**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13107v1)]<br/>Siyuan Niu, Akel Hashim, Costin Iancu, Wibe Albert de Jong, Ed Younis
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, mid-circuit measurement and
reset operations facilitate novel circuit optimization strategies by reducing a
circuit's qubit count in a method called resizing. This paper introduces two
such algorithms. The first one leverages gate-dependency rules to reduce qubit
count by 61.6% or 45.3% when optimizing depth as well. Based on numerical
instantiation and synthesis, the second algorithm finds resizing opportunities
in previously unresizable circuits via dependency rules and other
state-of-the-art tools. This resizing algorithm reduces qubit count by 20.7% on
average for these previously impossible-to-resize circuits.

**The signaling dimension in generalized probabilistic theories**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13103v1)]<br/>Michele Dall'Arno, Alessandro Tosini, Francesco Buscemi
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The signaling dimension of a given physical system quantifies the minimum
dimension of a classical system required to reproduce all input/output
correlations of the given system. Thus, unlike other dimension measures - such
as the dimension of the linear space or the maximum number of (jointly or
pairwise) perfectly discriminable states - which examine the correlation space
only along a single direction, the signaling dimension does not depend on the
arbitrary choice of a specific operational task. In this sense, the signaling
dimension summarizes the structure of the entire set of input/output
correlations consistent with a given system in a single scalar quantity. For
quantum theory, it was recently proved by Frenkel and Weiner in a seminal
result that the signaling dimension coincides with the Hilbert space dimension.
  Here, we derive analytical and algorithmic techniques to compute the
signaling dimension for any given system of any given generalized probabilistic
theory. We prove that it suffices to consider extremal measurements with
ray-extremal effects, and we bound the number of elements of any such
measurement in terms of the linear dimension. For systems with a finite number
of extremal effects, we recast the problem of characterizing the extremal
measurements with ray-extremal effects as the problem of deriving the vertex
description of a polytope given its face description, which can be conveniently
solved by standard techniques. For each such measurement, we recast the
computation of the signaling dimension as a linear program, and we propose a
combinatorial branch and bound algorithm to reduce its size. We apply our
results to derive the extremal measurements with ray-extremal effects of a
composition of two square bits (or squits) and prove that their signaling
dimension is five, even though each squit has a signaling dimension equal to
two.

**Contextual quantum metrology**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13084v1)]<br/>Jeongwoo Jae, Jiwon Lee, M. S. Kim, Kwang-Geol Lee, Jinhyoung Lee
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum metrology promises higher precision measurements than classical
methods. Entanglement has been identified as one of quantum resources to
enhance metrological precision. However, generating entangled states with high
fidelity presents considerable challenges, and thus attaining metrological
enhancement through entanglement is generally difficult. Here, we show that
contextuality of measurement selection can enhance metrological precision, and
this enhancement is attainable with a simple linear optical experiment. We call
our methodology "contextual quantum metrology" (coQM). Contextuality is a
nonclassical property known as a resource for various quantum information
processing tasks. Until now, it has remained an open question whether
contextuality can be a resource for quantum metrology. We answer this question
in the affirmative by showing that the coQM can elevate precision of an optical
polarimetry by a factor of 1.4 to 6.0, much higher than the one by quantum
Fisher information, known as the limit of conventional quantum metrology. We
achieve the contextuality-enabled enhancement with two polarization
measurements which are mutually complementary, whereas, in the conventional
method, some optimal measurements to achieve the precision limit are either
theoretically difficult to find or experimentally infeasible. These results
highlight that the contextuality of measurement selection is applicable in
practice for quantum metrology.

**Coherent control of molecular rotation in superfluid helium**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13077v1)]<br/>Alexander A. Milner, Ian MacPhail-Bartley, Katarina Preocanin, Shroyon Dasgupta, Xuanshan Peng, Valery Milner
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We experimentally demonstrate control of molecular rotation in bulk
superfluid $^4\mathrm{He}$. Metastable helium dimers, $\mathrm{He}_2^*$, are
rotationally excited by a periodic train of linearly polarized femtosecond
laser pulses. We show that the degree of rotational excitation of
$\mathrm{He}_2^*$ can be enhanced or suppressed by varying the period of the
pulse train, whereas the directionality of molecular rotation can be controlled
by the relative angle between the polarization vectors of pulses in the train.
The experimental results are in agreement with numerical calculations, based on
a simple model, in which $\mathrm{He}_2^*$ molecules do not interact with the
superfluid.

**Gaussian-basis many-body theory calculations of positron binding to negative ions and atoms**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13066v1)]<br/>J. Hofierka, B. Cunningham, C. M. Rawlins, C. H. Patterson, D. G. Green
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Positron binding energies in the negative ions H$^-$, F$^-$, Cl$^-$ and
Br$^-$, and the closed-shell atoms Be, Mg, Zn and Ca, are calculated via a
many-body theory approach developed by the authors [J.~Hofierka \emph{et al.}
Nature~{\bf 608}, 688-693 (2022)]. Specifically, the Dyson equation is solved
using a Gaussian basis, with the positron self energy constructed from three
infinite classes of diagrams that account for the strong positron-atom
correlations that characterise the system including the positron-induced
polarization of the electron cloud, screening of the electron-positron Coulomb
interaction, virtual-positronium formation and electron-hole and positron-hole
interactions. For the negative ions, binding occurs at the static level of
theory, and the correlations are found to enhance the binding energies by
$\sim$25--50\%, yielding results in good agreement with ($\lesssim$5\% larger
than) calculations from a number of distinct methods. For the atoms, for which
binding is enabled exclusively by correlations, most notably virtual-Ps
formation, the binding energies are found to be of similar order to (but
$\sim$10--30\% larger than) relativistic coupled-cluster calculations of [C.
Harabati, V.~A.~Dzuba and V.~V. Flambaum, Phys.~Rev.~A {\bf 89}, 022517
(2014)], both of which are systematically larger than stochastic variational
calculations of [M.~Bromley and J.~Mitroy, Phys.~Rev.~A {\bf 73} (2005);
J.~Mitroy, J.~At.~Mol.~Sci.~{\bf 1}, 275 (2010)].

**On-Demand Quantum Light Sources for Underwater Communications**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13065v1)]<br/>Dominic Scognamiglio, Angus Gale, Ali Al-Juboori, Milos Toth, Igor Aharonovich
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum communication has been at the forefront of modern research for
decades, however it is severely hampered in underwater applications, where the
properties of water absorb nearly all useful optical wavelengths and prevent
them from propagating more than, in most cases, a few metres. This research
reports on-demand quantum light sources, suitable for underwater optical
communication. The single photon emitters, which can be engineered using an
electron beam, are based on impurities in hexagonal boron nitride. They have a
zero phonon line at ~ 436 nm, near the minimum value of water absorption and
are shown to suffer negligible transmission and purity loss when travelling
through water channels. These emitters are also shown to possess exceptional
underwater transmission properties compared to emitters at other optical
wavelengths and are utilised in a proof of principle underwater communication
link with rates of several kbits/s.

**Fast Adaptive Optics for High-Dimensional Quantum Communications in Turbulent Channels**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13041v1)]<br/>Lukas Scarfe, Felix Hufnagel, Manuel F. Ferrer-Garcia, Alessio D'Errico, Khabat Heshami, Ebrahim Karimi
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) promises a provably secure method to transmit
information from one party to another. Free-space QKD allows for this
information to be sent over great distances and in places where fibre-based
communications cannot be implemented, such as ground-satellite. The primary
limiting factor for free-space links is the effect of atmospheric turbulence,
which can result in significant error rates and increased losses in QKD
channels. Here, we employ the use of a high-speed Adaptive Optics (AO) system
to make real-time corrections to the wavefront distortions on spatial modes
that are used for high-dimensional QKD in our turbulent channel. First, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the AO system in improving the coupling
efficiency of a Gaussian mode that has propagated through turbulence. Through
process tomography, we show that our system is capable of significantly
reducing the crosstalk of spatial modes in the channel. Finally, we show that
employing AO reduces the quantum dit error rate for a high-dimensional orbital
angular momentum-based QKD protocol, allowing for secure communication in a
channel where it would otherwise be impossible. These results are promising for
establishing long-distance free-space QKD systems.

**The Penrose Tiling is a Quantum Error-Correcting Code**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13040v1)]<br/>Zhi Li, Latham Boyle
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The Penrose tiling (PT) is an intrinsically non-periodic way of tiling the
plane, with many remarkable properties. A quantum error-correcting code (QECC)
is a clever way of protecting quantum information from noise, by encoding the
information with a sophisticated type of redundancy. Although PTs and QECCs
might seem completely unrelated, in this paper we point out that PTs give rise
to (or, in a sense, are) a remarkable new type of QECC in which any local
errors or erasures in any finite region, no matter how large, may be diagnosed
and corrected. We also construct variants of this code (based on the
Ammann-Beenker and Fibonacci tilings) that can live on finite spatial tori, in
discrete spin systems, or in an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions. We
discuss connections to quantum computing, condensed matter physics, and quantum
gravity.

**Extracting higher central charge from a single wave function**—2023-03-08 (updated: 2023-11-21)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04822v4)]<br/>Ryohei Kobayashi, Taige Wang, Tomohiro Soejima, Roger S. K. Mong, Shinsei Ryu
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  A (2+1)D topologically ordered phase may or may not have a gappable edge,
even if its chiral central charge $c_-$ is vanishing. Recently, it is
discovered that a quantity regarded as a "higher" version of chiral central
charge gives a further obstruction beyond $c_-$ to gapping out the edge. In
this Letter, we show that the higher central charges can be characterized by
the expectation value of the \textit{partial rotation} operator acting on the
wavefunction of the topologically ordered state. This allows us to extract the
higher central charge from a single wavefunction, which can be evaluated on a
quantum computer. Our characterization of the higher central charge is
analytically derived from the modular properties of edge conformal field
theory, as well as the numerical results with the $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin
state and the non-Abelian gapped phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model, which
corresponds to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ and Ising topological order respectively. The
letter establishes a numerical method to obtain a set of obstructions to the
gappable edge of (2+1)D bosonic topological order beyond $c_-$, which enables
us to completely determine if a (2+1)D bosonic Abelian topological order has a
gappable edge or not. We also point out that the expectation values of the
partial rotation on a single wavefunction put a constraint on the low-energy
spectrum of the bulk-boundary system of (2+1)D bosonic topological order,
reminiscent of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorems.

**Higher-group symmetry of (3+1)D fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory: logical CCZ, CS, and T gates from higher symmetry**—2023-11-09 (updated: 2023-11-21)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05674v2)]<br/>Maissam Barkeshli, Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  It has recently been understood that the complete global symmetry of finite
group topological gauge theories contains the structure of a higher-group. Here
we study the higher-group structure in (3+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with
an emergent fermion, and point out that pumping chiral $p+ip$ topological
states gives rise to a $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ 0-form symmetry with mixed
gravitational anomaly. This ordinary symmetry mixes with the other higher
symmetries to form a 3-group structure, which we examine in detail. We then
show that in the context of stabilizer quantum codes, one can obtain logical
CCZ and CS gates by placing the code on a discretization of $T^3$ (3-torus) and
$T^2 \rtimes_{C_2} S^1$ (2-torus bundle over the circle) respectively, and
pumping $p+ip$ states. Our considerations also imply the possibility of a
logical $T$ gate by placing the code on $\mathbb{RP}^3$ and pumping a $p+ip$
topological state.

**Ancilla quantum measurements on interacting chains: Sensitivity of entanglement dynamics to the type and concentration of detectors**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13011v1)]<br/>Elmer V. H. Doggen, Igor V. Gornyi, Alexander D. Mirlin
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We consider a quantum many-body lattice system that is coupled to ancillary
degrees of freedom ("detectors"), which are periodically measured by means of
strong projective measurements. The concentration $\rho_a$ of ancillae and
their coupling $M$ to the main system are considered as parameters. We explore
the dynamics of density and of entanglement entropy in the chain, for various
values of $\rho_a$ and $M$ for two models of the detector-chain interaction
that couple the local density in the chain to a detector degree of freedom. It
is found that, for the density-density ($S_z s_z$-type in spin language)
coupling, the critical values $M_c$ for the measurement-induced entanglement
transition depends sensitively on $\rho_a$. Moreover, our results indicate that
for a sufficiently small $\rho_a$ the transition in this model disappears,
i.e., a finite density of detectors is needed to reach a disentangling phase.
The behavior is qualitatively different for the second model, with
density-hopping ($S_z s_x$-type) coupling. Specifically, the dynamics is much
less sensitive to the concentration $\rho_a$ of detectors than in the first
model. Furthermore, the dependence of entanglement on the coupling strength $M$
is strongly non-monotonic, indicating re-entrance of the entangling phase at
large $M$.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  With great interest from the quantum computing community, an immense amount
of R&D effort has been invested into improving superconducting qubits. The
technologies developed for the design and fabrication of these qubits can be
directly applied to applications for ultra-low threshold particle detectors,
e.g. low-mass dark matter and far-IR photon sensing. We propose a novel sensor
based on the transmon qubit architecture combined with a signal-enhancing
superconducting quasiparticle amplification stage. We refer to these sensors as
SQUATs: Superconducting Quasiparticle-Amplifying Transmons. We detail the
operating principle and design of this new sensor and predict that with minimal
R&D effort, solid-state based detectors patterned with these sensors can
achieve sensitivity to single THz photons, and sensitivity to $1\,\mathrm{meV}$
phonons in the detector absorber substrate on the $\mu\mathrm{s}$ timescale.

**Continuous variable port-based teleportation**—2023-02-16 (updated: 2023-11-21)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08522v2)]<br/>Jason L. Pereira, Leonardo Banchi, Stefano Pirandola
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Port-based teleportation is generalization of the standard teleportation
protocol which does not require unitary operations by the receiver. This comes
at the price of requiring $N>1$ entangled pairs, while $N=1$ for the standard
teleportation protocol. The lack of correction unitaries allows port-based
teleportation to be used as a fundamental theoretical tool to simulate
arbitrary channels with a general resource, with applications to study
fundamental limits of quantum communication, cryptography and sensing, and to
define general programmable quantum computers. Here we introduce a general
formulation of port-based teleportation in continuous variable systems and
study in detail the $N=2$ case. In particular, we interpret the resulting
channel as an energy truncation and analyse the kinds of channels that can be
naturally simulated after this restriction.

**Quantum-enhanced cluster detection in physical images**—2022-08-10 (updated: 2023-11-21)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05522v2)]<br/>Jason L. Pereira, Leonardo Banchi, Stefano Pirandola
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Identifying clusters in data is an important task in many fields. In this
paper, we consider situations in which data live in a physical world, so we
have to first collect the images using sensors before clustering them. Using
sensors enhanced by quantum entanglement, we can image surfaces more accurately
than using purely classical strategies. However, it is not immediately obvious
if the advantage we gain is robust enough to survive data processing steps such
as clustering. It has previously been found that using quantum-enhanced sensors
for imaging and pattern recognition can give an advantage for supervised
learning tasks, and here we demonstrate that this advantage also holds for an
unsupervised learning task, namely clustering.

**Analytical bounds for non-asymptotic asymmetric state discrimination**—2022-07-21 (updated: 2023-11-21)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10699v3)]<br/>Jason L. Pereira, Leonardo Banchi, Stefano Pirandola
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Two types of errors can occur when discriminating pairs of quantum states.
Asymmetric state discrimination involves minimizing the probability of one type
of error, subject to a constraint on the other. We give explicit expressions
bounding the set of achievable errors, using the trace norm, the fidelity, and
the quantum Chernoff bound. The upper bound is asymptotically tight and the
lower bound is exact for pure states. Unlike asymptotic bounds, our bounds give
error values instead of exponents, so can give more precise results when
applied to finite-copy state discrimination problems.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In light of recently proposed quantum algorithms that incorporate symmetries
in the hope of quantum advantage, we show that with symmetries that are
restrictive enough, classical algorithms can efficiently emulate their quantum
counterparts given certain classical descriptions of the input. Specifically,
we give classical algorithms that calculate ground states and time-evolved
expectation values for permutation-invariant Hamiltonians specified in the
symmetrized Pauli basis with runtimes polynomial in the system size. We use
tensor-network methods to transform symmetry-equivariant operators to the
block-diagonal Schur basis that is of polynomial size, and then perform exact
matrix multiplication or diagonalization in this basis. These methods are
adaptable to a wide range of input and output states including those prescribed
in the Schur basis, as matrix product states, or as arbitrary quantum states
when given the power to apply low depth circuits and single qubit measurements.

**Hierarchical Learning for Quantum ML: Novel Training Technique for Large-Scale Variational Quantum Circuits**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12929v1)]<br/>Hrant Gharibyan, Vincent Su, Hayk Tepanyan
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We present hierarchical learning, a novel variational architecture for
efficient training of large-scale variational quantum circuits. We test and
benchmark our technique for distribution loading with quantum circuit born
machines (QCBMs). With QCBMs, probability distributions are loaded into the
squared amplitudes of computational basis vectors represented by bitstrings.
Our key insight is to take advantage of the fact that the most significant
(qu)bits have a greater effect on the final distribution and can be learned
first. One can think of it as a generalization of layerwise learning, where
some parameters of the variational circuit are learned first to prevent the
phenomena of barren plateaus. We briefly review adjoint methods for computing
the gradient, in particular for loss functions that are not expectation values
of observables. We first compare the role of connectivity in the variational
ansatz for the task of loading a Gaussian distribution on nine qubits, finding
that 2D connectivity greatly outperforms qubits arranged on a line. Based on
our observations, we then implement this strategy on large-scale numerical
experiments with GPUs, training a QCBM to reproduce a 3-dimensional
multivariate Gaussian distribution on 27 qubits up to $\sim4\%$ total variation
distance. Though barren plateau arguments do not strictly apply here due to the
objective function not being tied to an observable, this is to our knowledge
the first practical demonstration of variational learning on large numbers of
qubits. We also demonstrate hierarchical learning as a resource-efficient way
to load distributions for existing quantum hardware (IBM's 7 and 27 qubit
devices) in tandem with Fire Opal optimizations.

between the reflected single-photon field and laser light back-scattered at the

**Bulk reconstruction and non-isometry in the backwards-forwards holographic black hole map**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12921v1)]<br/>Oliver DeWolfe, Kenneth Higginbotham
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The backwards-forwards map, introduced as a generalization of the
non-isometric holographic maps of the black hole interior of Akers, Engelhardt,
Harlow, Penington, and Vardhan to include non-trivial dynamics in the effective
description, has two possible formulations differing in when the post-selection
is performed. While these two forms are equivalent on the set of dynamically
generated states -- states formed from unitary time evolution acting on
well-defined initial configurations of infalling matter -- they differ on the
generic set of states necessary to describe the apparent world of the infalling
observer. We show that while both versions successfully reproduce the Page
curve, the version involving post-selection as the final step, dubbed the
backwards-forwards-post-selection (BFP) map, has the desirable properties of
being non-isometric but isometric on average and providing state-dependent
reconstruction of bulk operators, while the other version does not. Thus the
BFP map is a suitable non-isometric code describing the black hole interior
including interior interactions.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Current quantum key distribution (QKD) networks focus almost exclusively on
transporting secret keys with the highest possible rate. Consequently, they are
built as mostly fixed, ad hoc, logically, and physically isolated
infrastructures designed to avoid any penalty to the quantum channel. This
architecture is neither scalable nor cost-effective and future, real-world
deployments will differ considerably. The structure of the MadQCI QKD network
presented here is based on disaggregated components and modern paradigms
especially designed for flexibility, upgradability, and facilitating the
integration of QKD in the security and telecommunications-networks ecosystem.
These underlying ideas have been tested by deploying many QKD systems from
several manufacturers in a real-world, multi-tenant telecommunications network,
installed in production facilities and sharing the infrastructure with
commercial traffic. Different technologies have been used in different links to
address the variety of situations and needs that arise in real networks,
exploring a wide range of possibilities. Finally, a set of realistic use cases
have been implemented to demonstrate the validity and performance of the
network. The testing took place during a period close to three years, where
most of the nodes were continuously active.

**Quantum Imaging Beyond the Standard-Quantum Limit and Phase Distillation**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12782v1)]<br/>Simon Schaffrath, Daniel Derr, Markus Gräfe, Enno Giese
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum sensing using non-linear interferometers offers the possibility of
bicolour imaging, using light that never interacted with the object of
interest, and provides a way to achieve phase supersensitivity, i.e. a
Heisenberg-type scaling of the phase uncertainty. Such a scaling behaviour is
extremely susceptible to noise and only arises at specific phases that define
the optimal working point of the device. While phase-shifting algorithms are to
some degree robust against the deleterious effects induced by noise they
extract an image by tuning the interferometer phase over a broad range,
implying an operation beyond the working point. In our theoretical study, we
investigate both the spontaneous and the high-gain regime of operation of a
non-linear interferometer. In fact, in the spontaneous regime using a
distillation technique and operating at the working point leads to a
qualitatively similar behaviour. In the high-gain regime, however, typical
distillation techniques inherently forbid a scaling better than the
standard-quantum limit, as a consequence of the photon statistics of squeezed
vacuum. In contrast, an operation at the working point still may lead to a
sensitivity below shot noise, even in the presence of noise. Therefore, this
procedure opens the perspective of bicolour imaging with a better than
shot-noise phase uncertainty by working in the vicinity of the working point.
Our results transfer quantum imaging distillation in a noisy environment to the
high-gain regime with the ultimate goal of harnessing its full potential by
combining bicolour imaging and phase supersensitivity.

**The T-Complexity Costs of Error Correction for Control Flow in Quantum Computation**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12772v1)]<br/>Charles Yuan, Michael Carbin
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Numerous quantum algorithms require the use of quantum error correction to
overcome the intrinsic unreliability of physical qubits. However, error
correction imposes a unique performance bottleneck, known as T-complexity, that
can make an implementation of an algorithm as a quantum program run more slowly
than on idealized hardware. In this work, we identify that programming
abstractions for control flow, such as the quantum if-statement, can introduce
polynomial increases in the T-complexity of a program. If not mitigated, this
slowdown can diminish the computational advantage of a quantum algorithm.
  To enable reasoning about the costs of control flow, we present a cost model,
using which a developer can analyze the T-complexity of a program under quantum
error correction and pinpoint the sources of slowdown. We also present a set of
program-level optimizations, using which a developer can rewrite a program to
reduce its T-complexity, predict the T-complexity of the optimized program
using the cost model, and then compile it to an efficient circuit via a
straightforward strategy.
  We implement the program-level optimizations in Spire, an extension of the
Tower quantum compiler. Using a set of 11 benchmark programs that use control
flow, we show that the cost model is accurate, and that Spire's optimizations
recover programs that are asymptotically efficient, meaning their runtime
T-complexity under error correction is equal to their time complexity on
idealized hardware.
  Our results show that optimizing a program before it is compiled to a circuit
can yield better results than compiling the program to an inefficient circuit
and then invoking a quantum circuit optimizer found in prior work. For our
benchmarks, only 2 of 8 existing circuit optimizers recover circuits with
asymptotically efficient T-complexity. Compared to these 2 optimizers, Spire
uses 54x to 2400x less compile time.

**Mod2VQLS: a Variational Quantum Algorithm for Solving Systems of Linear Equations Modulo 2**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12771v1)]<br/>Willie Aboumrad, Dominic Widdows
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  This paper presents a system for solving binary-valued linear equations using
quantum computers. The system is called Mod2VQLS, which stands for Modulo2
Variational Quantum Linear Solver. As far as we know, this is the first such
proposal. The design is a classical-quantum hybrid. The quantum components are
a new circuit design for implementing matrix multiplication modulo 2, and a
variational circuit to be optimized. The classical components are the optimizer
which measures the cost function and updates the quantum parameters for each
iteration, and the controller that runs the quantum job and classical optimizer
iterations. We propose two alternative ansatze or templates for the variational
circuit, and present results showing that the rotation ansatz designed
specifically for this problem provides the most direct path to a valid
solution. Numerical experiments in low dimensions indicate that Mod2VQLS, using
the custom rotations ansatz, is on-a-par with the block Wiedemann algorithm,
the best-known to date for this problem.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Thermodynamic computing exploits fluctuations and dissipation in physical
systems to efficiently solve various mathematical problems. For example, it was
recently shown that certain linear algebra problems can be solved
thermodynamically, leading to an asymptotic speedup scaling with the matrix
dimension. The origin of this "thermodynamic advantage" has not yet been fully
explained, and it is not clear what other problems might benefit from it. Here
we provide a new thermodynamic algorithm for exponentiating a real matrix, with
applications in simulating linear dynamical systems. We describe a simple
electrical circuit involving coupled oscillators, whose thermal equilibration
can implement our algorithm. We also show that this algorithm also provides an
asymptotic speedup that is linear in the dimension. Finally, we introduce the
concept of thermodynamic parallelism to explain this speedup, stating that
thermodynamic noise provides a resource leading to effective parallelization of
computations, and we hypothesize this as a mechanism to explain thermodynamic
advantage more generally.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Non-Hermitian physics predicts open quantum system dynamics with unique
topological features such as exceptional points and the non-Hermitian skin
effect. We show that this new paradigm of topological systems can serve as
probes for bulk Hamiltonian parameters with quantum-enhanced sensitivity
reaching Heisenberg scaling. Such enhancement occurs close to a spectral
topological phase transition, where the entire spectrum undergoes a
delocalization transition. We provide an explanation for this enhanced
sensitivity based on the closing of point gap, which is a genuinely
non-Hermitian energy gap with no Hermitian counterpart. This establishes a
direct connection between energy-gap closing and quantum enhancement in the
non-Hermitian realm. Our findings are demonstrated through several paradigmatic
non-Hermitian topological models in various dimensions and potential
experimental implementations.

**Measuring out quasi-local integrals of motion from entanglement**—2023-01-04 (updated: 2023-11-21)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01787v4)]<br/>B. Lu, C. Bertoni, S. J. Thomson, J. Eisert
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quasi-local integrals of motion are a key concept underpinning the modern
understanding of many-body localisation, an intriguing phenomenon in which
interactions and disorder come together. Despite the existence of several
numerical ways to compute them - and astoundingly in the light of the
observation that much of the phenomenology of many properties can be derived
from them - it is not obvious how to directly measure aspects of them in real
quantum simulations; in fact, the smoking gun of their experimental observation
is arguably still missing. In this work, we propose a way to extract the
real-space properties of such quasi-local integrals of motion based on a
spatially-resolved entanglement probe able to distinguish Anderson from
many-body localisation from non-equilibrium dynamics. We complement these
findings with a new rigorous entanglement bound and compute the relevant
quantities using tensor networks. We demonstrate that the entanglement gives
rise to a well-defined length scale that can be measured in experiments.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this study, we present Q-Seg, a novel unsupervised image segmentation
method based on quantum annealing, tailored for existing quantum hardware. We
formulate the pixel-wise segmentation problem, which assimilates spectral and
spatial information of the image, as a graph-cut optimization task. Our method
efficiently leverages the interconnected qubit topology of the D-Wave Advantage
device, offering superior scalability over existing quantum approaches and
outperforming state-of-the-art classical methods. Our empirical evaluations on
synthetic datasets reveal that Q-Seg offers better runtime performance against
the classical optimizer Gurobi. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on
segmentation of Earth Observation images, an area of application where the
amount of labeled data is usually very limited. In this case, Q-Seg
demonstrates near-optimal results in flood mapping detection with respect to
classical supervised state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Also, Q-Seg
provides enhanced segmentation for forest coverage compared to existing
annotated masks. Thus, Q-Seg emerges as a viable alternative for real-world
applications using available quantum hardware, particularly in scenarios where
the lack of labeled data and computational runtime are critical.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum annealing (QA) holds promise for optimization problems in quantum
computing, especially for combinatorial optimization. This analog framework
attracts attention for its potential to address complex problems. Its
gate-based homologous, QAOA with proven performance, has brought lots of
attention to the NISQ era. Several numerical benchmarks try to classify these
two metaheuristics however, classical computational power highly limits the
performance insights. In this work, we introduce a new parametrized version of
QA enabling a precise 1-local analysis of the algorithm. We develop a tight
Lieb-Robinson bound for regular graphs, achieving the best-known numerical
value to analyze QA locally. Studying MaxCut over cubic graph as a benchmark
optimization problem, we show that a linear-schedule QA with a 1-local analysis
achieves an approximation ratio over 0.7020, outperforming any known 1-local
algorithms.

**Cavity-mediated collective emission from few emitters in a diamond membrane**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12723v1)]<br/>Maximilian Pallmann, Kerim Köster, Yuan Zhang, Julia Heupel, Timon Eichhorn, Cyril Popov, Klaus Mølmer, David Hunger
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  When an ensemble of quantum emitters couples to a common radiation field,
their polarizations can synchronize and a collective emission termed
superfluorescence can occur. Entering this regime in a free-space setting
requires a large number of emitters with a high spatial density as well as
coherent optical transitions with small inhomogeneity. Here we show that by
coupling nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a diamond membrane to a high-finesse
microcavity, also few, incoherent, inhomogeneous, and spatially separated
emitters - as are typical for solid state systems - can enter the regime of
collective emission. We observe a super-linear power dependence of the emission
rate as a hallmark of collective emission. Furthermore, we find simultaneous
photon bunching and antibunching on different timescales in the second-order
auto-correlation function, revealing cavity-induced interference in the
quantized emission from about fifteen emitters. We develop theoretical models
for mesoscopic emitter numbers to analyze the behavior in the Dicke state basis
and find that the population of collective states together with cavity
enhancement and filtering can explain the observations. Such a system has
prospects for the generation of multi-photon quantum states, and for the
preparation of entanglement in few-emitter systems.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In many states of the quantum electromagnetic field, including the vacuum
state, entanglement exists between different space-time regions -- even
space-like separated ones. These correlations can be harvested and, thereby,
detected by quantum systems which locally interact with the field. Here, we
propose an experimental implementation of such an entanglement-harvesting
scheme which is based on electro-optic sampling (EOS). We demonstrate that
state-of-the-art EOS experiments enable one to harvest entanglement from the
vacuum field and to study quantum correlations within general THz fields. We
further show how Bell nonlocality present in the vacuum field can be probed.
Finally, we introduce a novel approach to mitigate shot noise in single-beam
EOS configurations. These findings pave the way for experimental inquiries into
foundational properties of relativistic quantum field theory, and empower EOS
as a diagnostic tool in THz quantum optics.

**General approach to realize optimized nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation**—2023-10-17 (updated: 2023-11-21)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10933v2)]<br/>Yue Heng Liu, Xin-Ding Zhang
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation has attracted much attention
in the quantum computation realm, however it is required to satisfy the cyclic
evolution and parallel transport conditions strictly. In order to relax the
parallel condition, the optimized nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation
was proposed which can be more possible to combine with most of the
optimization schemes. In this paper, we put forward the general form of reverse
Hamiltonian to realize the optimized nonadiabatic holonomic computation gate.
The Hamiltonian is only the function of path parameters in projective Hilbert
space, hence, we can realize arbitrary holonomic gates with any desired
evolution path. As same as other reverse approach, by using our reverse
Hamiltonian, we also can select some special evolution path to decrease the
path length and the pulse area to decrease the evolution time. Therefore our
approach might give a new horizon to realize high-fidelity quantum gate.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Previously proposed quantum algorithms for solving linear systems of
equations cannot be implemented in the near term due to the required circuit
depth. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, called
Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS), for solving linear systems on
near-term quantum computers. VQLS seeks to variationally prepare $|x\rangle$
such that $A|x\rangle\propto|b\rangle$. We derive an operationally meaningful
termination condition for VQLS that allows one to guarantee that a desired
solution precision $\epsilon$ is achieved. Specifically, we prove that $C \geq
\epsilon^2 / \kappa^2$, where $C$ is the VQLS cost function and $\kappa$ is the
condition number of $A$. We present efficient quantum circuits to estimate $C$,
while providing evidence for the classical hardness of its estimation. Using
Rigetti's quantum computer, we successfully implement VQLS up to a problem size
of $1024\times1024$. Finally, we numerically solve non-trivial problems of size
up to $2^{50}\times2^{50}$. For the specific examples that we consider, we
heuristically find that the time complexity of VQLS scales efficiently in
$\epsilon$, $\kappa$, and the system size $N$.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Hawking discovery that black holes can evaporate through radiation emission
has posed a number of questions that with time became fundamental hallmarks for
a quantum theory of gravity. The most famous one is likely the information
paradox, which finds an elegant explanation in the Page argument suggesting
that a black hole and its radiation can be effectively represented by a random
state of qubits. Leveraging the same assumption, we ponder the extent to which
a black hole may display emergent symmetries, employing the entanglement
asymmetry as a modern, information-based indicator of symmetry breaking. We
find that for a random state devoid of any symmetry, a $U(1)$ symmetry emerges
and it is exact in the thermodynamic limit before the Page time. At the Page
time, the entanglement asymmetry shows a finite jump to a large value. Our
findings imply that the emitted radiation is symmetric up to the Page time and
then undergoes a sharp transition. Conversely the black hole is symmetric only
after the Page time.

**Occupation Number Representation of Graph**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12675v1)]<br/>Haoqian Pan, Changhong Lu, Ben Yang
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this paper, we propose a new way to represent graphs in quantum space. In
that approach, we replace the rows of the adjacency matrix of the graph by
state vectors in the occupation number representation. Unlike the traditional
definition of graph states, we actually let the occupation number of a
single-particle state denote the number of edges between each two adjacent
vertices. This allows us to avoid taking into account the interaction between
each two particles. Based on the creation and annihilation operators, we
propose the edge creation and annihilation operators. With these two operators,
we can implement the fundamental operation of adding and removing edges and
vertices in a graph. Then all additional operations in the graph such as vertex
contractions can be defined. Our method can be used to represent both simple
and multigraphs. Directed and undirected graphs are also compatible with our
approach. The method of representation proposed in this paper enriches the
theory of graph representation in quantum space.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We show that weakly entangled states can improve communication over a qubit
channel using only separate, interference-free, measurements of individual
photons. We introduce a communication task corresponding to the cryptographic
primitive known as secret sharing and show that all steerable two-qubit
isotropic states provide a quantum advantage in the success rate using only
product measurements. Furthermore, we show that such measurements can even
reveal communication advantages from noisy partially entangled states that
admit no quantum steering. We then go further and consider a stochastic variant
of secret sharing based on more sophisticated, yet standard, partial Bell state
analysers, and show that this reveals advantages also for a range of
unsteerable isotropic states. By preparing polarisation qubits in unsteerable
states, we experimentally demonstrate improved success rates of both secret
sharing tasks beyond the best entanglement-unassisted qubit protocol. Our
results reveal the capability of simple and scalable measurements in
entanglement-assisted quantum communication to overcome large amounts of noise.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  A set of orthogonal multipartite quantum states is said to be
distinguishability-based genuinely nonlocal (also genuinely nonlocal, for
abbreviation) if the states are locally indistinguishable across any
bipartition of the subsystems. This form of multipartite nonlocality, although
more naturally arising than the recently popular "strong nonlocality" in the
context of local distinguishability, receives much less attention. In this
work, we study the distinguishability-based genuine nonlocality of a typical
type of genuine multipartite entangled states -- the d-dimensional GHZ states,
featuring systems with local dimension not limited to 2. In the three-partite
case, we find the existence of small genuinely nonlocal sets consisting of
these states: we show that the cardinality can at least scale down to linear in
the local dimension d, with the linear factor l = 1. Specifically, the method
we use is semidefinite program and the GHZ states to construct these sets are
special ones which we call "GHZ-lattices". This result might arguably suggest a
significant gap between the strength of strong nonlocality and the
distinguishability-based genuine nonlocality. Moreover, we put forward the
notion of (s,n)-threshold distinguishability and utilizing a similar method, we
successfully construct (2,3)-threshold sets consisting of GHZ states in
three-partite systems.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this work, we study the problem of constructing small sets of orthogonal
generalized GHZ states that are genuinely nonlocal -- namely, locally
indistinguishable through all bipartitions of the subsystems. We first discuss
genuine nonlocality of the canonical generalized GHZ basis. In the multi-qubit
case, using the language of group theory, we show that {\Theta}(2^(N/2)) states
among the N-qubit GHZ basis suffice to exhibit genuine nonlocality. Such result
can also be generalized to multi-qudit cases in some situations. Then we
consider generalized GHZ states which are not confined to the canonical form.
For any given number of parties N, it is shown that d + 1 genuinely nonlocal
generalized GHZ states in (C^d)^(\otimes N) exist, whenever the local dimension
d is large enough.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Within the many worlds interpretation (MWI) it is believed that, as time
passes on, the linearity of the Schr\"odinger equation together with
decoherence generate an exponentially growing tree of branches where
"everything happens", provided the branches are defined for a decohering basis.
By studying an example, using exact numerical diagonalization of the
Schr\"odinger equation to compute the decoherent histories functional, we find
that this picture needs revision. Our example shows decoherence for histories
defined at a few times, but a significant fraction (often the vast majority) of
branches shows strong interference effects for histories of many times. In a
sense made precise below, the histories independently sample an equilibrated
quantum process, and, remarkably, we find that only histories that sample
frequencies in accordance with Born's rule remain decoherent. Our results
suggest that there is more structure in the many worlds tree than previously
anticipated, influencing arguments of both proponents and opponents of the MWI.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We investigate the influence of local decoherence on a symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) phase of the two-dimensional (2D) cluster state. Mapping the
2D cluster state under decoherence to a classical spin model, we show a
topological phase transition of a
$\mathbb{Z}_2^{(0)}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{(1)}$ SPT phase into the trivial phase
occurring at a finite decoherence strength. To characterize the phase
transition, we employ three distinct diagnostic methods, namely, the relative
entropy between two decohered SPT states with different topological edge
states, the strange correlation function of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(1)}$ charge, and
the multipartite negativity of the mixed state on a disk. All the diagnostics
can be obtained as certain thermodynamic quantities in the corresponding
classical model, and the results of three diagnostic tests are consistent with
each other. Given that the 2D cluster state possesses universal computational
capabilities in the context of measurement-based quantum computation, the
topological phase transition found here can also be interpreted as a transition
in the computational power.

**Limitations of measure-first protocols in quantum machine learning**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12618v1)]<br/>Casper Gyurik, Riccardo Molteni, Vedran Dunjko
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In recent works, much progress has been made with regards to so-called
randomized measurement strategies, which include the famous methods of
classical shadows and shadow tomography. In such strategies, unknown quantum
states are first measured (or ``learned''), to obtain classical data that can
be used to later infer (or ``predict'') some desired properties of the quantum
states. Even if the used measurement procedure is fixed, surprisingly,
estimations of an exponential number of vastly different quantities can be
obtained from a polynomial amount of measurement data. This raises the question
of just how powerful ``measure-first'' strategies are, and in particular, if
all quantum machine learning problems can be solved with a measure-first,
analyze-later scheme. This paper explores the potential and limitations of
these measure-first protocols in learning from quantum data. We study a natural
supervised learning setting where quantum states constitute data points, and
the labels stem from an unknown measurement. We examine two types of machine
learning protocols: ``measure-first'' protocols, where all the quantum data is
first measured using a fixed measurement strategy, and ``fully-quantum''
protocols where the measurements are adapted during the training process. Our
main result is a proof of separation. We prove that there exist learning
problems that can be efficiently learned by fully-quantum protocols but which
require exponential resources for measure-first protocols. Moreover, we show
that this separation persists even for quantum data that can be prepared by a
polynomial-time quantum process, such as a polynomially-sized quantum circuit.
Our proofs combine methods from one-way communication complexity and
pseudorandom quantum states. Our result underscores the role of quantum data
processing in machine learning and highlights scenarios where quantum
advantages appear.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum error-correcting codes are crucial for quantum computing and
communication. Currently, these codes are mainly categorized into additive,
non-additive, and surface codes. Additive and non-additive codes utilize one or
more invariant subspaces of the stabilizer G to construct quantum codes.
Therefore, the selection of these invariant subspaces is a key issue. In this
paper, we propose a solution to this problem by introducing quotient space
codes and a construction method for quotient space quantum codes. This new
framework unifies additive and non-additive quantum codes. We demonstrate the
codeword stabilizer codes as a special case within this framework and
supplement its error-correction distance. Furthermore, we provide a simple
proof of the Singleton bound for this quantum code by establishing the code
bound of quotient space codes and discuss the code bounds for pure and impure
codes. The quotient space approach offers a concise and clear mathematical form
for the study of quantum codes.

applications from spectroscopy to super-resolution imaging. Despite this, the
precise measurement and characterisation of TPA parameters are challenging due
to their inherently weak nature. We study the potential of single-mode quantum
light to enhance TPA parameter estimation through the quantum Fisher
information (QFI). Discrete variable (DV) quantum states (defined to be a
finite superposition of Fock states) are optimised to maximise the QFI for
given absorption, revealing a quantum advantage compared to both the coherent
state (classical) benchmark and the single-mode squeezed vacuum state. For
fixed average energy $\bar{n} \in 2\mathbb{N}$, the Fock state is shown to be
optimal for large TPA parameters, while a superposition of vacuum and a
particular Fock state is optimal for small absorption for all $\bar{n}$. This
differs from single-photon absorption where the Fock state is always optimal.
Notably, photon counting is demonstrated to offer optimal or nearly optimal
performance compared to the QFI bound for all levels of TPA parameters for the
optimised quantum probes. Our findings provide insight into known limiting
behaviours of Gaussian probes and their different Fisher information (FI)
scalings under photon counting ($\propto \bar{n}^2$ for squeezed vacuum states
versus $\bar{n}^3$ for coherent states). The squeezed state outperforms
coherent states for small TPA parameters but underperforms in the intermediate
regime, becoming comparable in the large absorption limit. This can be
explained through fundamental differences between behaviours of even and odd
number Fock states: the former's QFI diverges in both large and small
absorption limits, while the latter diverges only in the small absorption
limit, dominating at intermediate scales.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  It is a fundamental question that why quantum mechanics uses complex numbers
instead of only real numbers. To address this topic, recently, a rigorous
resource theory for the imaginarity of quantum states were established, and
several imaginarity measures were proposed. In this work, we propose a new
imaginarity measure based on the Tsallis relative entropy. This imaginarity
measure has explicit expression, and also, it is computable for bosonic
Gaussian states.

**Relaxation of experimental parameters in a Quantum-Gravity Induced Entanglement of Masses Protocol using electromagnetic screening**—2023-07-14 (updated: 2023-11-21)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07536v2)]<br/>Martine Schut, Alexey Grinin, Andrew Dana, Sougato Bose, Andrew Geraci, Anupam Mazumdar

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  To test the quantum nature of gravity in a lab requires witnessing the
entanglement between the two test masses (nano-crystals) solely due to the
gravitational interaction kept at a distance in a spatial superposition. The
protocol is known as the quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM).
One of the main backgrounds in the QGEM experiment is electromagnetic (EM)
induced entanglement and decoherence. The EM interactions can entangle the two
neutral masses via dipole-dipole vacuum-induced interactions, such as the
Casimir-Polder interaction. To mitigate the EM-induced interactions between the
two nano-crystals, we enclose the two interferometers in a Faraday cage and
separate them by a conducting plate. However, any imperfection on the surface
of a nano-crystal, such as a permanent dipole moment will also create an EM
background interacting with the conducting plate in the experimental box. These
interactions will further generate EM-induced dephasing which we wish to
mitigate. In this paper, we will consider a parallel configuration of the QGEM
experiment, where we will estimate the EM-induced dephasing rate, run-by-run
systematic errors which will induce dephasing, and also provide constraints on
the size of the superposition in a model-independent way of creating the
spatial superposition.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Independent component analysis (ICA) is a fundamental data processing
technique to decompose the captured signals into as independent as possible
components. Computing the contrast function, which serves as a measure of
independence of signals, is vital in the separation process using ICA. This
paper presents a quantum ICA algorithm which focuses on computing a specified
contrast function on a quantum computer. Using the quantum acceleration in
matrix operations, we efficiently deal with Gram matrices and estimate the
contrast function with the complexity of
$O(\epsilon_1^{-2}\mbox{poly}\log(N/\epsilon_1))$. This estimation subprogram,
combined with the classical optimization framework, enables our quantum ICA
algorithm, which exponentially reduces the complexity dependence on the data
scale compared with classical algorithms. The outperformance is further
supported by numerical experiments, while a source separation of a
transcriptomic dataset is shown as an example of application.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum computing has shown tremendous promise in addressing complex
computational problems, yet its practical realization is hindered by the
limited availability of qubits for computation. Recent advancements in quantum
hardware have introduced mid-circuit measurements and resets, enabling the
reuse of measured qubits and significantly reducing the qubit requirements for
executing quantum algorithms. In this work, we present a systematic study of
dynamic quantum circuit compilation, a process that transforms static quantum
circuits into their dynamic equivalents with a reduced qubit count through
qubit-reuse. We establish the first general framework for optimizing the
dynamic circuit compilation via graph manipulation. In particular, we
completely characterize the optimal quantum circuit compilation using binary
integer programming, provide efficient algorithms for determining whether a
given quantum circuit can be reduced to a smaller circuit and present heuristic
algorithms for devising dynamic compilation schemes in general. Furthermore, we
conduct a thorough analysis of quantum circuits with practical relevance,
offering optimal compilations for well-known quantum algorithms in quantum
computation, ansatz circuits utilized in quantum machine learning, and
measurement-based quantum computation crucial for quantum networking. We also
perform a comparative analysis against state-of-the-art approaches,
demonstrating the superior performance of our methods in both structured and
random quantum circuits. Our framework lays a rigorous foundation for
comprehending dynamic quantum circuit compilation via qubit-reuse, bridging the
gap between theoretical quantum algorithms and their physical implementation on
quantum computers with limited resources.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We study how the information flows in many-body dynamics governed by random
quantum circuits and discover a rich set of dynamical phase transitions in this
information flow. The phase transition points and their critical exponents are
established across Clifford and Haar random circuits through finite-size
scaling. The flow of both classical and quantum information, measured
respectively by Holevo and coherent information, shows similar dynamical phase
transition behaviors. We investigate how the phase transitions depend on the
initial location of the information and the final probe region, and find
ubiquitous behaviors in these transitions, revealing interesting properties
about the information propagation and scrambling in this quantum many-body
model. Our work underscores rich behaviors of the information flow in large
systems with numerous phase transitions, thereby sheds new light on the
understanding of quantum many-body dynamics.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Gradient based optimization methods are the established state-of-the-art
paradigm to study strongly entangled quantum systems in two dimensions with
Projected Entangled Pair States. However, the key ingredient, the gradient
itself, has proven challenging to calculate accurately and reliably in the case
of a corner transfer matrix (CTM)-based approach. Automatic differentiation
(AD), which is the best known tool for calculating the gradient, still suffers
some crucial shortcomings. Some of these are known, like the problem of
excessive memory usage and the divergences which may arise when differentiating
a singular value decomposition (SVD). Importantly, we also find that there is a
fundamental inaccuracy in the currently used backpropagation of SVD that had
not been noted before. In this paper, we describe all these problems and
provide them with compact and easy to implement solutions. We analyse the
impact of these changes and find that the last problem -- the use of the
correct gradient -- is by far the dominant one and thus should be considered a
crucial patch to any AD application that makes use of an SVD for truncation.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Reinforcement learning for the optimization of quantum circuits uses an agent
whose goal is to maximize the value of a reward function that decides what is
correct and what is wrong during the exploration of the search space. It is an
open problem how to formulate reward functions that lead to fast and efficient
learning. We propose an exponential reward function which is sensitive to
structural properties of the circuit. We benchmark our function on circuits
with known optimal depths, and conclude that our function is reducing the
learning time and improves the optimization. Our results are a next step
towards fast, large scale optimization of quantum circuits.

  In ab-initio electronic structure simulations, fermion-to-qubit mappings
represent the initial encoding step of the fermionic problem into qubits. This
work introduces a physically-inspired method for constructing mappings that
significantly simplify entanglement requirements when simulating states of
interest. The presence of electronic excitations drives the construction of our
mappings, reducing correlations for target states in the qubit space. To
benchmark our method, we simulate ground states of small molecules and observe
an enhanced performance when compared to classical and quantum variational
approaches from prior research employing conventional mappings. In particular,
on the quantum side, our mappings require a reduced number of entangling layers
to achieve chemical accuracy for the $LiH$, $H_2$, $(H_2)_2$ and $H_4$
molecules using the RY hardware efficient ansatz. In addition, our mappings
also provide an enhanced ground state simulation performance in the density
matrix renormalization group algorithm for the $N_2$ molecule.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computations will be enabled by quantum
error-correcting codes (QECC). This work presents the first systematic
technique to test the accuracy and effectiveness of different QECC decoding
schemes by comparing a look-up table decoder to solutions generated using
algorithmic decoders. Specifically, we examine the results of
minimum-weight-perfect-matching and belief-propagation decoders against
exhaustive look-up tables for surface codes up to distance seven and categorise
where errors are accurately corrected in both decoding schemes. While our
results are preliminary, we show that significant quantitative results can be
generated, comparing how actual error channels are successfully or
unsuccessfully decoded. We show that different decoding schemes perform very
differently under the same QECC scheme and error model, and detail how decoders
can be tested and classified with respect to errors that are successfully
decodable. This work paves the way to the data driven tuning of decoder
ensembles and will enable tailored design of hybrid decoding schemes that allow
for real-time decoding, while maintaining the high theoretical thresholds
allowed by specific quantum error correction codes.

**Cost Explosion for Efficient Reinforcement Learning Optimisation of Quantum Circuits**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12498v1)]<br/>Ioana Moflic, Alexandru Paler
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Large scale optimisation of quantum circuits is a computationally challenging
problem. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a recent approach for learning
strategies to optimise quantum circuits by increasing the reward of an
optimisation agent. The reward is a function of the quantum circuit costs, such
as gate and qubit counts, or circuit depth. Our goal is to improve the agent's
optimization strategy, by including hints about how quantum circuits are
optimized manually: there are situations when the cost of a circuit should be
allowed to temporary explode, before applying optimisations which significantly
reduce the circuit's cost. We bring numerical evidence, using
Bernstein-Vazirani circuits, to support the advantage of this strategy. Our
results are preliminary, and show that allowing cost explosions offers
significant advantages for RL training, such as reaching optimum circuits. Cost
explosion strategies have the potential to be an essential tool for RL of
large-scale quantum circuit optimisation.

**Quantum Mechanics on a background modulo observation**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12493v1)]<br/>Jose A. Pereira Frugone
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this work we will answer the following question: What remains of Quantum
Mechanics when we transform the background space-time into a space modularized
by observation or measurement regions ? This new moduli space is constructed by
identifying regions of space-time where quantum phase comparison (observation,
measurement) is implied. We call it Observation Modular space (OM-space). In
addition we replace in QM statements the Plank constant (h) by the quantity
$\zeta_0 4 \pi^2$ (where $\zeta_0$ is the Plank Length) or otherwise, replacing
$P_0$ (the Planck Momentum) by $4 \pi^2$. This maps Quantum Mechanics into a
very rich dual Number Theory which we call Observation Modular Quantum
Mechanics (OM-QM). We find the OM-dual to the Dirac Equation, the quantum Wave
Function and a free particle's mass. The OM-QM counterparts of the Energy turns
out to be a simple function of the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function. We also
find the OM-QM correspondents to the electron spin, the electron charge, the
Electric Field and the Fine Structure Constant. We also find the OM-QM
correspondents of the Heisemberg uncertainty relation and Einstein's General
Relativity Field equation emerging as certain limits of a unique OM-QM
equation. We also get the OM-QM correspondents of the Gravitational Constant
and the Cosmological Constant. We find the analog of holography in the OM-QM
side and we get an interpretation of spin as a high dimensional curvature. An
interpretation of the OM-QM correspondence is proposed as giving the part of QM
information which is not measurement or observation dependent. Some potential
future applications of this correspondence are discussed.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Diamond Tin-Vacancy centers have emerged as a promising platform for quantum
information science and technology. A key challenge for their use in more
complex quantum experiments and scalable applications is the ability to prepare
the center in the desired charge state with the optical transition at a
pre-defined frequency. Here we report on heralding such successful preparation
using a combination of laser excitation, photon detection, and real-time logic.
We first show that fluorescence photon counts collected during an optimized
resonant probe pulse strongly correlate with the subsequent charge state and
optical transition frequency, enabling real-time heralding of the desired state
through threshold photon counting. We then implement and apply this heralding
technique to photoluminescence excitation measurements, coherent optical
driving, and an optical Ramsey experiment, finding strongly improved optical
coherence with increasing threshold. Finally, we demonstrate that the prepared
optical frequency follows the probe laser across the inhomogeneous linewidth,
enabling tuning of the transition frequency over multiple homogeneous
linewidths.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We report on the existence of exceptional points (EPs) in single-resonance
autoionization and provide analytical expressions for their positions in
parameter space, in terms of the Fano asymmetry parameter. We additionally
propose a reliable method for the experimental determination of EPs, based
solely on information about their ionization probability as a function of the
system parameters. The links between EPs, the maxima of the asymmetric profile
and the effective decay rate of the ground state are investigated in detail.
Quantitative numerical examples pertaining to the doubly excited $2s2p({}^1P)$
state of Helium confirm the validity of our formulation and results. In
addition to unveiling hidden aspects of autoionization, our treatment and
results provide a benchmark for the exploration of EPs and their properties in
a variety of materials exhibiting Fano profiles with a broad perspective of

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Lie algebraic techniques are powerful and widely-used tools for studying
dynamics and metrology in quantum optics. When the Hamiltonian generates a Lie
algebra with finite dimension, the unitary evolution can be expressed as a
finite product of exponentials using the Wei-Norman expansion. The system is
then exactly described by a finite set of scalar differential equations, even
if the Hilbert space is infinite. However, the differential equations provided
by the Wei-Norman expansion are nonlinear and often have singularities that
prevent both analytic and numerical evaluation. We derive a new Lie algebra
expansion for the quantum Fisher information, which results in linear
differential equations. Together with existing Lie algebra techniques this
allows many metrology problems to be analysed entirely in the Heisenberg
picture. This substantially reduces the calculations involved in many metrology
problems, and provides analytical solutions for problems that cannot even be
solved numerically using the Wei-Norman expansion. We provide detailed examples
of these methods applied to problems in quantum optics and nonlinear
optomechanics.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We consider the Brownian SYK, i.e. a system of $N$ Majorana (Dirac) fermions
with a white-noise $q$-body interaction term. We focus on the dynamics of the
Frame potentials, a measure of the scrambling and chaos, given by the moments
of the overlap between two independent realisations of the model. By means of a
Keldysh path-integral formalism, we compute its early and late-time value. We
show that, for $q>2$, the late time path integral saddle point correctly
reproduces the saturation to the value of the Haar frame potential. On the
contrary, for $q=2$, the model is quadratic and consistently we observe
saturation to the Haar value in the restricted space of Gaussian states
(Gaussian Haar). The latter is characterised by larger system size corrections
that we correctly capture by counting the Goldstone modes of the Keldysh saddle
point. Finally, in the case of Dirac fermions, we highlight and resolve the
role of the global $U(1)$ symmetry.

**Quantum Communication Complexity of Classical Auctions**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12444v1)]<br/>Aviad Rubinstein, Zixin Zhou
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We study the fundamental, classical mechanism design problem of single-buyer
multi-item Bayesian revenue-maximizing auctions under the lens of communication
complexity between the buyer and the seller. Specifically, we ask whether using
quantum communication can be more efficient than classical communication. We
have two sets of results, revealing a surprisingly rich landscape - which looks
quite different from both quantum communication in non-strategic parties, and
classical communication in mechanism design.
  We first study the expected communication complexity of approximately optimal
auctions. We give quantum auction protocols for buyers with unit-demand or
combinatorial valuations that obtain an arbitrarily good approximation of the
optimal revenue while running in exponentially more efficient communication
compared to classical approximately optimal auctions. However, these auctions
come with the caveat that they may require the seller to charge exponentially
large payments from a deviating buyer. We show that this caveat is necessary -
we give an exponential lower bound on the product of the expected quantum
communication and the maximum payment.
  We then study the worst-case communication complexity of exactly optimal
auctions in an extremely simple setting: additive buyer's valuations over two
items. We show the following separations:
  1. There exists a prior where the optimal classical auction protocol requires
infinitely many bits, but a one-way message of 1 qubit and 2 classical bits
suffices.
  2. There exists a prior where no finite one-way quantum auction protocol can
obtain the optimal revenue. However, there is a barely-interactive
revenue-optimal quantum auction protocol.
  3. There exists a prior where no multi-round quantum auction protocol with a
finite bound on communication complexity can obtain the optimal revenue.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Recently Freedman & Hastings asked for a mathematical theory that would unify
quantum entanglement/tensor-structure with parameterized/bundle-structure via
their amalgamation (a hypothetical pushout) along bare quantum (information)
theory. As a proposed answer to this question, we first make precise a form of
the relevant pushout diagram in monoidal category theory. Then we prove that
the pushout produces what is known as the *external* tensor product on vector
bundles/K-classes, or rather on flat such bundles (flat K-theory), i.e., those
equipped with monodromy encoding topological Berry phases. The bulk of our
result is a further homotopy-theoretic enhancement of the situation to the
"derived category" (infinity-category) of flat infinity-vector bundles
("infinity-local systems") equipped with the "derived functor" of the external
tensor product. Concretely, we present an integral model category of simplicial
functors into simplicial K-chain complexes which conveniently presents the
infinity-category of parameterized HK-module spectra over varying base spaces
and is equipped with homotopically well-behaved external tensor product
structure. In concluding we indicate how this model category serves as
categorical semantics for the linear-multiplicative fragment of Linear Homotopy
Type Theory (LHoTT), which is thus exhibited as a universal quantum programming
language. This is the context in which we recently showed that topological
anyonic braid quantum gates are native objects in LHoTT.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Direct air capture of Carbon Dioxide is a technical solution that does not
rely on natural processes to capture CO2 from the atmosphere. In DAC, the
filter material is designed to specifically bind CO2 molecules. Hence a
high-capacity filter is sought. We aim to leverage the potential of quantum
computing to improve the filters used in DAC. Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)
have high surface area and tunable pore sizes which makes them an attractive
material for gas storage and separation. Using the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, we find the minimum of the potential energy
surface (PES) by first considering only the active site of the MOF (the metal
ion). For complex systems, we employ Density Matrix Embedding Theory and use
VQE as a fragment solver at the binding site. Techniques like
deparameterisation are used to minimise the count of trainable parameters. We
present results of ideal and noisy simulations as well as from a real hardware
device. Resources are estimated for MOFs unit cell. The findings from our study
demonstrates the potential of quantum computing to effectively perform quantum
simulations of strongly correlated fragments.

**Light bipolarons in a system of electrons coupled to dispersive optical phonons**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12403v1)]<br/>K. Kovač, J. Bonča
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We investigate the ground state properties of the bipolaron coupled to
quantum dispersive optical phonons in the one-dimensional Holstein-Hubbard
model. We concentrate on the interplay between the phonon dispersion and the
Coulomb repulsion and their mutual effect on the bipolaron effective mass, the
binding energy, and the phase diagram. Most surprisingly, the sign of the
curvature of the optical phonon dispersion plays a decisive role on the
bipolaron binding energy in the presence of the Coulomb repulsion $U$. In
particular, when the sign of the phonon dispersion curvature matches the sign
of the electron dispersion curvature, the bipolaron remains bound in the strong
coupling limit even when $U\to \infty$ and the binding emanates from the
exchange of phonons between two electrons residing on adjacent sites. At
moderate electron-phonon coupling a light bipolaron exists up to large values
of $U$. Finally, an intuitive explanation of the role of the phonon dispersion
on the bipolaron binding energy is derived using the strong coupling limit
where the binding emanates from the exchange of phonons between two electrons
residing on adjacent sites which leads to enhanced stability of bipolarons at
elevated Coulomb repulsion.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The laws of quantum physics place a limit on the speed of computation. In
particular, the evolution time of a system from an initial state to a final
state cannot be arbitrarily short. Bounds on the speed of evolution for unitary
dynamics have long been studied. A few bounds on the speed of evolution for
noisy dynamics have also been obtained recently, which, however, are in general
not tight. In this paper, we present a new framework for quantum speed limit
concerning noisy dynamics. Within this framework we obtain the exact maximal
rotation angle that noisy dynamics can achieve at any given time, which gives
rise to a tight bound on the evolution time for noisy dynamics. The obtained
bound clearly reveals that noisy dynamics are essentially different from
unitary dynamics. Furthermore, we show that the orthogonalization time, which
is the minimum time needed to evolve any state to its orthogonal state, is in
general not applicable to noisy dynamics.

operators are sampled as $n\times n$ random Hermitian matrices satisfying
certain assumptions. We show that when the Kraus rank goes to infinity with n,
the limiting spectral distribution (suitably rescaled) of the corresponding
quantum channel coincides with the semi-circle distribution. When the Kraus
rank is fixed, the limiting spectral distribution is no longer the semi-circle
distribution. It corresponds to an explicit law, which can also be described
using tools from free probability.

**Genuinely accessible and inaccessible entanglement in Schwarzschild black hole**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12362v1)]<br/>Shu-Min Wu, Xiao-Wei Teng, Jin-Xuan Li, Si-Han Li, Tong-Hua Liu, Jie-Ci Wang
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The genuine entanglement of Dirac fields for an N-partite system is
investigated in Schwarzschild spacetime and the analysis is carried out using
the single-mode approximation. Due to the Hawking effect, quantum entanglement
is divided into two parts physically accessible and inaccessible entanglement.
We obtain a general analytic expression of genuine N-partite entanglement that
includes all accessible and inaccessible entanglement in a Schwarzschild black
hole. Unlike bosonic entanglement, the accessible N-partite entanglement of
Dirac fields monotonically decreases to a nonzero value with the Hawking
temperature. Interestingly, the inaccessible N-partite entanglement is a
monotonic or non-monotonic function of the Hawking temperature, depending on
the ratio between accessible and inaccessible modes, in contrast to bipartite
or tripartite entanglement that is only a monotonic function of the Hawking
temperature. Finally, we obtain two restrictive relationships for the quantum
information of the black hole. This conclusion provides a new understanding of
Hawking effect of the black hole.

**Comparative study of decoding the surface code using simulated annealing under depolarizing noise**—2023-11-14 (updated: 2023-11-21)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07973v2)]<br/>Yusaku Takeuchi, Yugo Takada, Tatsuya Sakashita, Jun Fujisaki, Hirotaka Oshima, Shintaro Sato, Keisuke Fujii
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We explored decoding methods for the surface code under depolarizing noise by
mapping the problem into the Ising model optimization. We consider two kinds of
mapping with and without a soft constraint and also various optimization
solvers, including simulated annealing implemented on a CPU, "Fujitsu Digital
Annealer" (DA), a hardware architecture specialized for the Ising problems, and
CPLEX, an exact integer programming solver. We find that the proposed
Ising-based decoding approaches provide higher accuracy compared to the
minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm for depolarizing noise and
comparable to minimum distance decoding using CPLEX. While decoding time is
longer than MWPM when we compare it with a single core CPU, our method is
amenable to parallelization and easy to implement on dedicated hardware,
suggesting potential future speedups. Regarding the mapping methods to the
Ising model with and without a soft constraint, the SA decoder yielded higher
accuracy without a soft constraint. In contrast, the DA decoder shows less
difference between the two mapping methods, which indicates that DA can find a
better solution with smaller number of iterations even under the soft
constraint. Our results are important for devising efficient and fast decoders
feasible with quantum computer control devices.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  For quantum computing (QC) to emerge as a practically indispensable
computational tool, there is a need for quantum protocols with an end-to-end
practical applications -- in this instance, fluid dynamics. We debut here a
high performance quantum simulator which we term QFlowS (Quantum Flow
Simulator), designed for fluid flow simulations using QC. Solving nonlinear
flows by QC generally proceeds by solving an equivalent infinite dimensional
linear system as a result of linear embedding. Thus, we first choose to
simulate two well known flows using QFlowS and demonstrate a previously unseen,
full gate-level implementation of a hybrid and high precision Quantum Linear
Systems Algorithms (QLSA) for simulating such flows at low Reynolds numbers.
The utility of this simulator is demonstrated by extracting error estimates and
power law scaling that relates $T_{0}$ (a parameter crucial to Hamiltonian
simulations) to the condition number $\kappa$ of the simulation matrix, and
allows the prediction of an optimal scaling parameter for accurate eigenvalue
estimation. Further, we include two speedup preserving algorithms for (a) the
functional form or sparse quantum state preparation, and (b) \textit{in-situ}
quantum post-processing tool for computing nonlinear functions of the velocity
field. We choose the viscous dissipation rate as an example, for which the
end-to-end complexity is shown to be $\mathcal{O}(\textrm{polylog}
(N/\epsilon)\kappa/\epsilon_{QPP})$, where $N$ is the size of the linear system
of equations, $\epsilon$ is the the solution error and $\epsilon_{QPP}$ is the
error in post processing. This work suggests a path towards quantum simulation
of fluid flows, and highlights the special considerations needed at the gate
level implementation of QC.

**A Qubit, a Coin, and an Advice String Walk Into a Relational Problem**—2023-02-20 (updated: 2023-11-21)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10332v2)]<br/>Scott Aaronson, Harry Buhrman, William Kretschmer
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Relational problems (those with many possible valid outputs) are different
from decision problems, but it is easy to forget just how different. This paper
initiates the study of FBQP/qpoly, the class of relational problems solvable in
quantum polynomial-time with the help of polynomial-sized quantum advice, along
with its analogues for deterministic and randomized computation (FP, FBPP) and
advice (/poly, /rpoly).
  Our first result is that FBQP/qpoly != FBQP/poly, unconditionally, with no
oracle -- a striking contrast with what we know about the analogous decision
classes. The proof repurposes the separation between quantum and classical
one-way communication complexities due to Bar-Yossef, Jayram, and Kerenidis. We
discuss how this separation raises the prospect of near-term experiments to
demonstrate "quantum information supremacy," a form of quantum supremacy that
would not depend on unproved complexity assumptions.
  Our second result is that FBPP is not contained in FP/poly -- that is,
Adleman's Theorem fails for relational problems -- unless PSPACE is contained
in NP/poly. Our proof uses IP=PSPACE and time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. On
the other hand, we show that proving FBPP not in FP/poly will be hard, as it
implies a superpolynomial circuit lower bound for PromiseBPEXP.
  We prove the following further results: * Unconditionally, FP != FBPP and
FP/poly != FBPP/poly (even when these classes are carefully defined). *
FBPP/poly = FBPP/rpoly (and likewise for FBQP). For sampling problems, by
contrast, SampBPP/poly != SampBPP/rpoly (and likewise for SampBQP).

**Optimal, and approximately optimal, quantum strategies for $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$ and $\mathrm{FFL}$ games**—2023-11-21—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12887v1)]<br/>Pete Rigas
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We analyze optimal, and approximately optimal, quantum strategies for a
variety of non-local XOR games. Building upon previous arguments due to Ostrev
in 2016, which characterized approximately optimal, and optimal, strategies
that players Alice and Bob can adopt for maximizing a linear functional to win
non-local games after a Referee party examines each answer to a question drawn
from some probability distribution, we identify additional applications of the
framework for analyzing the performance of a broader class of quantum
strategies in which it is possible for Alice and Bob to realize quantum
advantage if the two players adopt strategies relying upon quantum
entanglement, two-dimensional resource systems, and reversible transformations.
For the Fortnow-Feige-Lovasz (FFL) game, the 2016 framework is directly
applicable, which consists of five steps, including: (1) constructing a
suitable, nonzero, linear transformation for the intertwining operations, (2)
demonstrating that the operator has unit Frobenius norm, (3) constructing error
bounds, and corresponding approximate operations, for $\big( A_k \otimes
\textbf{I} \big) \ket{\psi}$, and $\big( \textbf{I} \otimes \big( \frac{\pm
B_{kl} + B_{lk}}{\sqrt{2}} \big) \big) \ket{\psi}$, (4) constructing additional
bounds for permuting the order in which $A^{j_i}_i$ operators are applied, (5)
obtaining Frobenius norm upper bounds for Alice and Bob's strategies. We draw
the attention of the reader to applications of this framework in other games
with less regular structure.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The rapid advancement of quantum computing has generated considerable
anticipation for its transformative potential. However, harnessing its full
potential relies on identifying "killer applications". In this regard, QuGeo
emerges as a groundbreaking quantum learning framework, poised to become a key
application in geoscience, particularly for Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI). This
framework integrates variational quantum circuits with geoscience, representing
a novel fusion of quantum computing and geophysical analysis. This synergy
unlocks quantum computing's potential within geoscience. It addresses the
critical need for physics-guided data scaling, ensuring high-performance
geoscientific analyses aligned with core physical principles. Furthermore,
QuGeo's introduction of a quantum circuit custom-designed for FWI highlights
the critical importance of application-specific circuit design for quantum
computing. In the OpenFWI's FlatVelA dataset experiments, the variational
quantum circuit from QuGeo, with only 576 parameters, achieved significant
improvement in performance. It reached a Structural Similarity Image Metric
(SSIM) score of 0.905 between the ground truth and the output velocity map.
This is a notable enhancement from the baseline design's SSIM score of 0.800,
which was achieved without the incorporation of physics knowledge.

accelerates the processing process but also improves the accuracy of
classifying diverse stellar types, setting a new benchmark in astronomical data

  Diatomic molecular codes [{arXiv:1911.00099}] are designed to encode quantum
information in the orientation of a diatomic molecule, allowing error
correction from small torques and changes in angular momentum. Here, we
directly study noise native to atomic and molecular platforms -- spontaneous
emission, stray electromagnetic fields, and Raman scattering -- and derive
simple necessary and sufficient conditions for codes to protect against such
noise. We identify existing and develop new absorption-emission (\AE) codes
that are more practical than molecular codes, require lower average momentum,
can directly protect against photonic processes up to arbitrary order, and are
applicable to a broader set of atomic and molecular systems.

**Data is often loadable in short depth: Quantum circuits from tensor networks for finance, images, fluids, and proteins**—2023-09-22 (updated: 2023-11-21)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13108v2)]<br/>Raghav Jumade, Nicolas PD Sawaya
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Though there has been substantial progress in developing quantum algorithms
to study classical datasets, the cost of simply loading classical data is an
obstacle to quantum advantage. When the amplitude encoding is used, loading an
arbitrary classical vector requires up to exponential circuit depths with
respect to the number of qubits. Here, we address this "input problem" with two
contributions. First, we introduce a circuit compilation method based on tensor
network (TN) theory. Our method -- AMLET (Automatic Multi-layer Loader
Exploiting TNs) -- proceeds via careful construction of a specific TN topology
and can be tailored to arbitrary circuit depths. Second, we perform numerical
experiments on real-world classical data from four distinct areas: finance,
images, fluid mechanics, and proteins. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the broadest numerical analysis to date of loading classical data into a
quantum computer. Consistent with other recent work in this area, the required
circuit depths are often several orders of magnitude lower than the
exponentially-scaling general loading algorithm would require. Besides
introducing a more efficient loading algorithm, this work demonstrates that
many classical datasets are loadable in depths that are much shorter than
previously expected, which has positive implications for speeding up classical
workloads on quantum computers.

orbital and an outer-shell 2p orbital. We found that entanglement occurs
between spin of photoelectrons and linear polarization of emitted X-ray
photons, using the wavefunction of the whole system including the photon as
well as the electron system. Furthermore, we calculated the degree of
entanglement and found that it shows maximum at a particular angle of emitted
X-ray photon.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The entanglement production is key for many applications in the realm of
quantum information, but so is the identification of processes that allow to
create entanglement in a fast and sustained way. Most of the advances in this
direction have been circumscribed to bipartite systems only, and the rate of
entanglement in multipartite system has been much less explored.Here we
contribute to the identification of processes that favor the fastest and
sustained generation of tripartite entanglement in a class of 3-qubit GHZ-type
states. By considering a three-party interaction Hamiltonian, we analyse the
dynamics of the 3-tangle and the entanglement rate to identify the optimal
local operations that supplement the Hamiltonian evolution in order to speed-up
the generation of three-way entanglement, and to prevent its decay below a
predetermined threshold value. The appropriate local operation that maximizes
the speed at which a highly-entangled state is reached has the advantage of
requiring access to only one of the qubits, yet depends on the actual state of
the system. Other universal (state-independent) local operations are found that
conform schemes to maintain a sufficiently high amount of 3-tangle. Our results
expand our understanding of entanglement rates to multipartite systems, and
offer guidance regarding the strategies that improve the efficiency in various
quantum information processing tasks.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum networks are networks of quantum devices that can communicate and
perform computations using quantum states. Entangled states are the building
blocks of quantum computing and are essential for many tasks such as quantum
teleportation, quantum key distribution, quantum sensing and quantum error
correction. Graph states are a specific class of multipartite entangled states
that can be represented by graphs. We propose a novel approach for distributing
graph states across a noiseless quantum network. We show that the distribution
of graph states can be characterized by a system of subgraph complementations,
which we also relate to the minimum rank of the underlying graph and the degree
of entanglement quantified by the Schmidt-rank of the quantum state. We analyze
resource usage for our algorithm and show that it improves on the number of
qubits, bits for classical communication and EPR pairs utilized, as compared to
prior work. The number of local operations and resource consumption for our
approach scales linearly in the number of vertices. This produce a quadratic
improvement in completion time for several classes of graph states represented
by dense graphs, and suggests the potential for improved fidelity in the
presence of noise. Common classes of graph states are classified along with the
optimal time for their distribution using subgraph complementations. We also
provide a framework to similarly find the optimal sequence of subgraph
complementation operations to distribute an arbitrary graph state, and
establish upper bounds on distribution time along with providing approximate
greedy algorithms.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this paper we study the cooperation between coherent control and noises in
open spin systems, aiming to demonstrate that such cooperation can provide new
possibilities for parametrization in quantum metrology. The cooperative scheme
proposed here outperforms the standard scheme, with higher precision achieved.
More specifically, we illustrate the effect of cooperative interaction between
coherent control and noises in conventional single-spin systems described by
Lindblad master equations, with the magnitude of a magnetic field taken as the
parameter to be estimated and encoded in the noisy dynamics besides the
Hamiltonian. The scenarios of both spontaneous emission and dephasing noise
have been analyzed, where the associated quantum Fisher information has been
given. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that in the realm where quantum
metrology is mostly applied in practice, the precision limit under the
cooperative scheme in the presence of noises can surpass the ultimate precision
limit under the unitary dynamics. On the other hand, multiple-spin systems have
also been considered. We show that the coupling between different spins can
help realize non-local parametrization under the cooperative scheme, with the
ground state made entangled. This thus leads to the improvement of precision
limit, which has been proved and visualized in our paper.

  Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon,
providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its
failure. Here we characterize the MBL phase geometrically by the many-body
quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary. We
find that MBQM scales linearly as a function of the inverse system length in
the MBL phase, and grows faster in the ergodic phase. We validate our theory
using the disordered hardcore Bose-Hubbard model, and characterize the ergodic
to MBL phase transition via the localization length scale defined from the
MBQM. MBQM provides an intuitive and experimentally accessible method to
characterize MBL phases.

basic, but sometimes misunderstood, concepts of quantum information based on
the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics that will be useful for
chemists interested in discovering ways that chemistry can contribute to the
quantum information field. We cover topics including qubits and their density
matrix formalism, quantum measurement as a quantum operation, information
theory, and entanglement. We focus on the difference between the concepts in
the quantum context and the classic context. We also discuss the relation and
distinction among entanglement, correlation, and coherence. We aim to clarify
the rigorous definition of these concepts, and then indicate some examples in
physical chemistry.

  We demonstrate qubit state measurements assisted by a supervised
convolutional neural network (CNN) in a neutral atom quantum processor. We
present two CNN architectures for analyzing neutral atom qubit readout data: a
compact 5-layer single-qubit CNN architecture and a 6-layer multi-qubit CNN
architecture. We benchmark both architectures against a conventional Gaussian
threshold analysis method. In a sparse array (9 {\mu}m atom separation) which
experiences negligible crosstalk, we observed up to 32% and 56% error reduction
for the multi-qubit and single-qubit architectures respectively, as compared to
the benchmark. In a tightly spaced array (5 {\mu}m atom separation), which
suffers from readout crosstalk, we observed up to 43% and 32% error reduction
in the multi-qubit and single-qubit CNN architectures respectively, as compared
to the benchmark. By examining the correlation between the predicted states of
neighboring qubits, we found that the multi-qubit CNN architecture reduces the
crosstalk correlation up to 78.5%. This work demonstrates a proof of concept
for a CNN network to be implemented as a real-time readout processing method on
a neutral atom quantum computer, enabling faster readout time and improved
fidelity.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In the field of monitored quantum circuits, it has remained an open question
whether finite-time protocols for preparing long-range entangled states lead to
phases of matter which are stable to gate imperfections, which can convert
projective into weak measurements. Here we show that in certain cases,
long-range entanglement persists in the presence of weak measurements, and
gives rise to novel forms of quantum criticality. We demonstrate this
explicitly for preparing the two-dimensional Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger cat
state and the three-dimensional toric code as minimal instances. In contrast to
the monitored random unitary circuits, In contrast to random monitored
circuits, our circuit of gates and measurements is deterministic; the only
randomness is in the measurement outcomes. We show how the randomness in these
weak measurements allows us to track the solvable Nishimori line of the
random-bond Ising model, rigorously establishing the stability of the glassy
long-range entangled states in two and three spatial dimensions. Away from this
exactly solvable construction, we use hybrid tensor network and Monte Carlo
simulations to obtain a nonzero Edwards-Anderson order parameter as an
indicator of long-range entanglement in the two-dimensional scenario. We argue
that our protocol admits a natural implementation in existing quantum computing
architectures, requiring only a depth-3 circuit on IBM's heavy-hexagon transmon
chips.

metric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classical
case, one such examples is the inception score. In this paper, we propose the
quantum inception score, which relates the quality to the classical capacity of
the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. We prove that, under this
proposed measure, the quantum generative models provide better quality than
their classical counterparts because of the presence of quantum coherence and
entanglement. Finally, we harness the quantum fluctuation theorem to
characterize the physical limitation of the quality of quantum generative
models.

**Universality in long-distance geometry and quantum complexity**—2021-11-24 (updated: 2023-11-20)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12700v2)]<br/>Adam R. Brown, Michael H. Freedman, Henry W. Lin, Leonard Susskind
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In physics, two systems that radically differ at short scales can exhibit
strikingly similar macroscopic behaviour: they are part of the same
long-distance universality class. Here we apply this viewpoint to geometry and
initiate a program of classifying homogeneous metrics on group manifolds by
their long-distance properties. We show that many metrics on low-dimensional
Lie groups have markedly different short-distance properties but nearly
identical distance functions at long distances, and provide evidence that this
phenomenon is even more robust in high dimensions. An application of these
ideas of particular interest to physics and computer science is complexity
geometry--the study of quantum computational complexity using Riemannian
geometry. We argue for the existence of a large universality class of
definitions of quantum complexity, each linearly related to the other, a much
finer-grained equivalence than typically considered. We conjecture that a new
effective metric emerges at larger complexities that describes a broad class of
complexity geometries, insensitive to various choices of microscopic penalty
factors. We discuss the implications for recent conjectures in quantum gravity.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In large $N$ chaotic quantum systems, the butterfly effect is mediated by a
collective field mode known as the ``scramblon.'' We study self-interactions of
the scramblon in variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. In spatially extended
versions of the model and for large spatial separation, fluctuations described
by loop diagrams can invalidate the single-scramblon approximation well before
its contribution to out-of-time-order correlators becomes of order one. We find
a qualitative difference between an incoherent regime at high temperaure (or in
a Brownian version of the model) and a coherent regime at low temperature.

**Emergent Ashkin-Teller criticality in a constrained boson model**—2023-11-20—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12107v1)]<br/>Anirudha Menon, Anwesha Chattopadhyay, K. Sengupta, Arnab Sen
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We show, via explicit computation on a constrained bosonic model, that the
presence of subsystem symmetries can lead to a quantum phase transition where
the critical point exhibits an emergent enhanced symmetry. Such a transition
separates a unique gapped ground state from a gapless one; the latter phase
exhibits a broken $Z_2$ symmetry which we tie to the presence of the subsystem
symmetries in the model. The intermediate critical point separating these
phases exhibits an additional emergent $Z_2$ symmetry which we identify; this
emergence leads to a critical theory in the Ashkin-Teller, instead of the
expected Ising, universality class . We verify this scenario via explicit
exact-diagonalization computations, provide an effective Landau-Ginzburg theory
for such a transition, and discuss the connection of our model to the PXP model
describing Rydberg atom arrays.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Given a local Hamiltonian, how difficult is it to determine the entanglement
structure of its ground state? We show that this problem is computationally
intractable even if one is only trying to decide if the ground state is
volume-law vs near area-law entangled. We prove this by constructing strong
forms of pseudoentanglement in a public-key setting, where the circuits used to
prepare the states are public knowledge. In particular, we construct two
families of quantum circuits which produce volume-law vs near area-law
entangled states, but nonetheless the classical descriptions of the circuits
are indistinguishable under the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption.
Indistinguishability of the circuits then allows us to translate our
construction to Hamiltonians. Our work opens new directions in Hamiltonian
complexity, for example whether it is difficult to learn certain phases of
matter.

**Efficient Algorithms for All Port-Based Teleportation Protocols**—2023-11-20—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12012v1)]<br/>Adam Wills, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Sergii Strelchuk
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Port-based teleportation (PBT) is a form of quantum teleportation in which no
corrective unitary is required on the part of the receiver. Two primary regimes
exist - deterministic PBT in which teleportation is always successful, but is
imperfect, and probabilistic PBT, in which teleportation succeeds with
probability less than one, but teleportation is perfect upon a success. Two
further regimes exist within each of these in which the resource state used for
the teleportation is fixed to a maximally entangled state, or free to be
optimised.
  Recently, works resolved the long-standing problem of efficiently
implementing port-based teleportation, tackling the two deterministic cases for
qudits. Here, we provide algorithms in all four regimes for qubits. Emphasis is
placed on the practicality of these algorithms, where we give polynomial
improvements in the known gate complexity for PBT, as well as an exponential
improvement in the required number of ancillas (albeit in separate protocols).
As one example, we provide an algorithm for probabilistic PBT using a maximally
entangled resource state over $N$ ports implemented to accuracy $\epsilon$ with
gate complexity $\mathcal{O}(N\text{poly}(\log N, \log \frac{1}{\epsilon}))$.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Many problems in quantum dynamics can be cast as the decay of a single
quantum state into a continuum. The time-dependent overlap with the initial
state, called the fidelity, characterizes this decay. We derive an analytic
expression for the fidelity after a quench to an ergodic Hamiltonian. The
expression is valid for both weak and strong quenches, and timescales before
finiteness of the Hilbert space limits the fidelity. It reproduces initial
quadratic decay and asymptotic exponential decay with a rate which, for strong
quenches, differs from Fermi's golden rule. The analysis relies on the
statistical Jacobi approximation (SJA), which was originally applied in nearly
localized systems, and which we here adapt to well-thermalizing systems. Our
results demonstrate that the SJA is predictive in disparate regimes of quantum
dynamics.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The paradigm behind digital quantum computing inherits the idea of using
binary information processing. The nature in fact gives much more rich
structures of physical objects that can be used for encoding information, which
is especially interesting in the quantum mechanical domain. In this Colloquium,
we review several ideas indicating how multilevel quantum systems, also known
as qudits, can be used for efficient realization of quantum algorithms, which
are represented via standard qubit circuits. We focus on techniques of
leveraging qudits for simplifying decomposition of multiqubit gates, and for
compressing quantum information by encoding multiple qubits in a single qudit.
As we discuss, these approaches can be efficiently combined. This allows
reducing in the number of entangling (two-body) operations and the number of
the used quantum information carriers compared to straightforward qubit
realizations. These theoretical schemes can be implemented with quantum
computing platforms of various nature, such as trapped ions, neutral atoms,
superconducting junctions, and quantum light. We conclude with summarizing a
set of open problems, whose resolving is an important further step towards
employing universal qudit-based processors for running qubit algorithms.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We compute the evolution of the entanglement entropy for a massless field
within a spherical region throughout the inflationary period and the subsequent
era of radiation domination, starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum. The
transition of each mode towards a squeezed state upon horizon exit during
inflation and the additional squeezing when radiation domination sets in
enhance the entanglement entropy. Shortly after the transition to the
radiation-dominated era, a volume term develops and becomes the leading
contribution to the entropy at late times, as is common for systems lying in
squeezed states. We estimate the magnitude of the entropy and discuss its
interpretation in the light of the quantum to classical transition for modes
exiting the horizon during inflation. Our results raise the possibility that
the quantum nature of weakly interacting fields, such as gravitational waves
resulting from tensor modes during inflation, may be detectable in today's
universe. On the other hand, an observer with no knowledge of the degrees of
freedom beyond the horizon would interpret the entropy as thermal. From this
point of view, the reheating after inflation would be a result of quantum
entanglement.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The interaction between a quantum system and its environment limits our
ability to control it and perform quantum operations on it. We present an
efficient method to find optimal controls for quantum systems coupled to
non-Markovian environments, by using the process tensor to compute the gradient
of an objective function. We consider state transfer for a driven two-level
system coupled to a bosonic environment, and characterize performance in terms
of speed and fidelity. We thus determine the best achievable fidelity as a
function of process duration. We show there is a trade-off between speed and
fidelity, and that slower processes can have higher fidelity by exploiting
non-Markovian effects.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We analyze the efficiency of protocols for adiabatic quantum state transfer
assisted by an engineered reservoir. The target dynamics is a quantum
trajectory in the Hilbert space and is the fixed point of a time-dependent
master equation. We specialize to quantum state transfer in a qubit and
determine the optimal schedule for a class of time-dependent Lindblad
equations. The speed limit on state transfer is extracted from a physical model
of a qubit coupled to a reservoir, from which the Lindblad equation is derived
in the Born-Markov limit. Our analysis shows that the resulting efficiency is
comparable to the efficiency of the optimal unitary dynamics. Numerical studies
indicate that reservoir-engineered protocols could outperform unitary protocols
outside the regime of the Born-Markov master equation, namely, when
correlations between the qubit and reservoir become relevant. Our study
contributes to the theory of shortcuts to adiabaticity for open quantum systems
and to the toolbox of protocols of the NISQ era.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We present a digitization scheme for the lattice $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge
theory Hamiltonian in the $\mathit{magnetic}$ $\mathit{basis}$, where the gauge
links are unitary and diagonal. The digitization is obtained from a particular
partitioning of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ group manifold, with the canonical momenta
constructed by an approximation of the Lie derivatives on this partitioning.
This construction, analogous to a discrete Fourier transform, preserves the
spectrum of the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian and the canonical commutation
relations exactly on a subspace of the truncated Hilbert space, while the
residual subspace can be projected above the cutoff of the theory.

  We present analytic solutions to the evolution in generalized tight-binding
models, which consider complex first-neighbor couplings with equal amplitude
and arbitrary phases. Our findings provide a powerful tool for efficiently
calculating expectation values and correlations within the system, which are
otherwise difficult to compute numerically. We apply our results to relevant
examples in quantum light manipulation using N-port linear couplers, describing
the evolution of single(multi)-mode squeezing, single photon added (subtracted)
Gaussian states, and second-order site-to-site photon correlations.
Significantly, our analytic results outperform standard numerical calculations.

theory in the traditional associative setting. Our algebraic approach is
naturally probabilistic and is based on the universal enveloping algebra of a
general nonassociative algebra. We formulate properties of states together with
notions of trace, and use them to develop GNS constructions. We describe
Heisenberg and Schrodinger pictures of completely positive dynamics, and we
illustrate our formalism on the explicit examples of finite-dimensional matrix
Jordan algebras as well as the octonion algebra.

  This paper presents several notable properties of the matrix $\mathbb{U}$
shown to be related to the isomorphism between $H_4$ and $E_8$. The most
significant of these properties is that $\mathbb{U}$.$\mathbb{U}$ is to rank 8
matrices what the golden ratio is to numbers. That is to say, the difference
between it and its inverse is the identity element, albeit with a twist.
Specifically, $\mathbb{U}$.$\mathbb{U}$-$ (\mathbb{U}$.$\mathbb{U})^{-1}$ is
the reverse identity matrix or standard involutory permutation matrix of rank
8. It has the same palindromic characteristic polynomial coefficients as the
normalized 3-qubit Hadamard matrix with 8-bit binary basis states, which is
known to be isomorphic to E8 through its (8,4) Hamming code.

**Rapid cooling of the in-plane motion of two-dimensional ion crystals in a Penning trap to millikelvin temperatures**—2023-11-20—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11906v1)]<br/>Wes Johnson, Athreya Shankar, John Zaris, John Bollinger, Scott E. Parker
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  A two-dimensional planar crystal of ions stored in a Penning trap offers an
attractive platform for quantum sensing and simulation protocols using hundreds
of ions. However, recent work indicates that poorly cooled in-plane motion
leads to significant excess potential energy fluctuations in the crystal, which
can adversely impact the fidelity of these protocols. Here, we propose a highly
feasible technique with no experimental overhead to significantly improve the
planar laser cooling. Through simulations, we demonstrate a resonant mode
coupling technique that can enable cooling of the planar motion to a
temperature of around 1 mK in less than 10 ms. This is in contrast to typical
experimental conditions, where our simulations of the laser cooling dynamics
suggest that the ion crystal's planar motion cools on a timescale of several
hundreds of milliseconds, a rate likely slower than experimental heating rates.
This work sets the stage for sub-Doppler laser cooling of the planar motion and
more robust quantum science experiments with two-dimensional crystals in
Penning traps.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We explore a new pathway to designing unclonable cryptographic primitives. We
propose a new notion called unclonable puncturable obfuscation (UPO) and study
its implications for unclonable cryptography. Using UPO, we present modular
(and arguably, simple) constructions of many primitives in unclonable
cryptography, including public-key quantum money, quantum copy-protection for
many classes of functionalities, unclonable encryption, and single-decryption
encryption. Notably, we obtain the following new results assuming the existence
of UPO: We show that any cryptographic functionality can be copy-protected as
long as this functionality satisfies a notion of security, which we term as
puncturable security. Prior feasibility results focused on copy-protecting
specific cryptographic functionalities. We show that copy-protection exists for
any class of evasive functions as long as the associated distribution satisfies
a preimage-sampleability condition. Prior works demonstrated copy-protection
for point functions, which follows as a special case of our result. We show
that unclonable encryption exists in the plain model. Prior works demonstrated
feasibility results in the quantum random oracle model. We put forward a
candidate construction of UPO and prove two notions of security, each based on
the existence of (post-quantum) sub-exponentially secure indistinguishability
obfuscation and one-way functions, the quantum hardness of learning with
errors, and a new conjecture called simultaneous inner product conjecture.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  A diamond-based sensor utilizing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles
permits the analysis of micron-sized samples through NMR techniques at room
temperature. Current efforts are directed towards extending the operating range
of NV centers into high magnetic fields, driven by the potential for larger
nuclear spin polarization of the target sample and the presence of enhanced
chemical shifts. Especially interesting is the access to J-couplings as they
carry information of chemical connectivity inside molecules. In this work, we
present a protocol to access J-couplings in both homonuclear and heteronuclear
cases with NV centers at high magnetic fields. Our protocol leads to a clear
spectrum exclusively containing J-coupling features with high resolution. This
resolution is limited primarily by the decoherence of the target sample, which
is mitigated by the noise filtering capacities of our method.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Adversarial robustness and generalization are both crucial properties of
reliable machine learning models. In this paper, we study these properties in
the context of quantum machine learning based on Lipschitz bounds. We derive
tailored, parameter-dependent Lipschitz bounds for quantum models with
trainable encoding, showing that the norm of the data encoding has a crucial
impact on the robustness against perturbations in the input data. Further, we
derive a bound on the generalization error which explicitly depends on the
parameters of the data encoding. Our theoretical findings give rise to a
practical strategy for training robust and generalizable quantum models by
regularizing the Lipschitz bound in the cost. Further, we show that, for fixed
and non-trainable encodings as frequently employed in quantum machine learning,
the Lipschitz bound cannot be influenced by tuning the parameters. Thus,
trainable encodings are crucial for systematically adapting robustness and
generalization during training. With numerical results, we demonstrate that,
indeed, Lipschitz bound regularization leads to substantially more robust and
generalizable quantum models.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Measuring an observable that does not commute with the system's Hamiltonian
usually leads to a variation of its energy. Unveiling the first link of the von
Neumann chain, the quantum meter has to account for this energy change. Here,
we consider an autonomous meter-system dynamics: a qubit interacting
dispersively with a light pulse propagating in a one-dimensional waveguide. The
light pulse (the meter) measures the qubit's state along the $z$-axis while the
qubit's Hamiltonian is oriented along another direction. As the interaction is
dispersive, photon number is conserved so that energy balance has to be
attained by spectral deformations of the light pulse. An accurate and
repeatable measurement can be achieved only by employing short pulses, where
their spectral deformation is practically undetectable. Increasing the pulse's
duration, the measurement's quality drops and the spectral deformation of the
scattered field becomes visible. Building on analytical and numerical
solutions, we reveal the mechanism underlying this spectral deformation and
display how it compensates for the qubit's energy change. We explain the
formation of a three-peak structure of the output spectrum and we provide the
conditions under which this is observable.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Simultaneous measurement of multiple Pauli strings (tensor products of Pauli
matrices) is the basis for efficient measurement of observables on quantum
computers by partitioning the observable into commuting sets of Pauli strings.
We present the implementation and optimisation of the Baranyai grouping method
for second quantised Hamiltonian partitioning in molecules up to CH$_4$
(cc-pVDZ, 68 qubits) and efficient construction of the diagonalisation circuit
in $O(N)$ quantum gates, compared to $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the number of
qubits. We show that this method naturally handles sparsity in the Hamiltonian
and produces a $O(1)$ number of groups for linearly scaling Hamiltonians, such
as those formed by molecules in a line; rising to $O(N^3)$ for fully connected
two-body Hamiltonians. While this is more measurements than some other schemes
it allows for the flexibility to move Pauli strings and optimise the variance.
We also present an explicit optimisation for spin-symmetry which reduces the
number of groups by a factor of $8$, without extra computational effort.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum thermodynamics and quantum entanglement represent two pivotal quantum
resource theories with significant relevance in quantum information science.
Despite their importance, the intricate relationship between these two theories
is still not fully understood. Here, we delve into the interplay between
entanglement and thermodynamics, particularly in the context of local cooling
processes. We introduce and develop the framework of Gibbs-preserving local
operations and classical communication. Within this framework, we explore
strategies enabling remote parties to effectively cool their local systems to
the ground state. Our analysis is centered on scenarios where only a single
copy of a quantum state is accessible, with the ideal performance defined by
the highest possible fidelity to the ground state achievable under these
constraints. We focus on systems with fully degenerate local Hamiltonians,
where local cooling aligns with the extraction of local purity. In this
context, we establish a powerful link between the efficiency of local purity
extraction and the degree of entanglement present in the system, a concept we
define as purity-entanglement complementarity. Moreover, we demonstrate that in
many pertinent scenarios, the optimal performance can be precisely determined
through semidefinite programming techniques. Our findings open doors to various
practical applications, including techniques for entanglement detection and
estimation. We demonstrate this by evaluating the amount of entanglement for a
class of bound entangled states.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We study the photophysics of molecular aggregates from a quantum optics
perspective, with emphasis on deriving scaling laws for the fast non-radiative
relaxation of collective electronic excitations, referred to as Kasha's rule.
At deep subwavelength separations, arrays of quantum emitters exhibit an
energetically broad manifold of collective states with delocalized electronic
excitations originating from near field dipole-dipole exchanges between the
aggregate's monomers. Photo-excitation with visible light addresses almost
exclusively symmetric collective states, which for an arrangement known as
H-aggregate, show an upward hypsochromic shift. The extremely fast subsequent
non-radiative relaxation via intramolecular vibrational modes then populates
lower energy, subradiant states which results in the effective inhibition of
fluorescence. Our treatment allows for the derivation of an approximate linear
scaling law of this relaxation process with the number of available low energy
vibrational modes and reveals its direct proportionality to the dipole-dipole
interaction strength between neighbouring monomers.

  We show that measurement incompatibility is a necessary resource to enhance
the precision of quantum metrology. To utilize incompatible measurements, we
propose a probabilistic method of operational quasiprobability (OQ) consisting
of the measuring averages. OQ becomes positive semidefinite for some quantum
states. We prove that Fisher information (FI), based on positive OQ, can be
larger than the conventional quantum FI. Applying the proof, we show that FI of
OQ can be extremely larger than quantum FI, when estimating a parameter encoded
onto a qubit state with two mutually unbiased measurements. By adopting maximum
likelihood estimator and linear error propagation methods, we illustrate that
they achieve the high precision that our model predicts. This approach is
expected to be applicable to improve quantum sensors.

dynamical constraint models, it is still challenging to tune HSF. Here, we
propose a scheme to tune HSF in a one-dimensional tilted lattice of interacting
spinless fermions with periodically driven tunneling. The dynamics is governed
by effective Hamiltonians with kinetic constraints, which appear as
density-dependent tunneling in the weak-tunneling perturbation expansion. The
kinetic constraint can be tuned via changing the driving frequency, and three
different kinds of strong HSF can be engineered. In general, the system is
strongly constrained and exhibits a strong HSF. Two partial resonance
frequencies are analytically given by a time-dependent perturbation theory for
Floquet systems, at which some kinetic constraints are released and the system
exhibits another two different strong HSF. We demonstrate the perturbation
analysis with exact numerical simulation of the entanglement entropy, the
density correlation functions and the saturated local density profiles. Our
result provides a promising way to control HSF through Floquet engineering.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The precise measurement of low temperatures is significant for both the
fundamental understanding of physical processes and technological applications.
In this work, we present a method for low-temperature measurement that improves
thermal range and sensitivity by generating quantum coherence in a thermometer
probe. Typically, in temperature measurements, the probes thermalize with the
sample being measured. However, we use a two-level quantum system, or qubit, as
our probe and prevent direct probe access to the sample by introducing a set of
ancilla qubits as an interface. We describe the open system dynamics of the
probe using a global master equation and demonstrate that while the
ancilla-probe system thermalizes with the sample, the probe \textit{per se}
evolves into a nonthermal steady state due to nonlocal dissipation channels.
The populations and coherences of this steady state depend on the sample
temperature, allowing for precise and wide-range low-temperature estimation. We
characterize the thermometric performance of the method using quantum Fisher
information and show that the quantum Fisher information can exhibit multiple
and higher peaks at different low temperatures with increasing quantum
coherence and the number of ancilla qubits. Our analysis reveals that the
proposed approach, using a nonthermal qubit thermometer probe with
temperature-dependent quantum coherence generated by a multiple qubit interface
between a thermal sample and the probe qubit, can enhance the sensitivity of
temperature estimation and broaden the measurable low-temperature range.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Classical information loading is an essential task for many processing
quantum algorithms, constituting a cornerstone in the field of quantum machine
learning. In particular, the embedding techniques based on Hamiltonian
simulation techniques enable the loading of matrices into quantum computers. A
representative example of these methods is the Lloyd-Mohseni-Rebentrost
protocol, which efficiently implements matrix exponentiation when multiple
copies of a quantum state are available. However, this is a quite ideal set up,
and in a realistic scenario, the copies are limited and the non-cloning theorem
prevents from producing more exact copies in order to increase the accuracy of
the protocol. Here, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation by
introducing imperfect quantum copies that significantly enhance the performance
of previous proposals.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We use a Rydberg quantum simulator to demonstrate a new form of spectroscopy,
called quench spectroscopy, which probes the low-energy excitations of a
many-body system. We illustrate the method on a two-dimensional simulation of
the spin-1/2 dipolar XY model. Through microscopic measurements of the spatial
spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extract the dispersion
relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic
couplings. We observe qualitatively different behaviors between the two cases
that result from the long-range nature of the interactions, and the frustration
inherent in the antiferromagnet. In particular, the ferromagnet exhibits
elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves. In the anti-ferromagnet,
spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities.
Our demonstration highlights the importance of power-law interactions on the
excitation spectrum of a many-body system.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  While early magnetic memory designs relied on magnetization switching by
locally generated magnetic fields, key insights in condensed matter physics
later suggested the possibility to do it electrically. In the 1990s,
Slonczewzki and Berger formulated the concept of current-induced spin torques
in magnetic multilayers through which a spin-polarized current may switch the
magnetization of a ferromagnet. This discovery drove the development of
spin-transfer-torque magnetic random-access memories (STT-MRAMs). More recent
research unveiled spin-orbit-torques (SOTs) and will lead to a new generation
of devices including SOT-MRAMs. Parallel to these advances, multiferroics and
their magnetoelectric coupling experienced a renaissance, leading to novel
device concepts for information and communication technology such as the MESO
transistor. The story of the electrical control of magnetization is that of a
dance between fundamental research (in spintronics, condensed matter physics,
and materials science) and technology (MRAMs, MESO, microwave emitters,
spin-diodes, skyrmion-based devices, components for neuromorphics, etc). This
pas de deux led to major breakthroughs over the last decades (pure spin
currents, magnetic skyrmions, spin-charge interconversion, etc). As a result,
this field has propelled MRAMs into consumer electronics products but also
fueled discoveries in adjacent research areas such as ferroelectrics or
magnonics. Here, we cover recent advances in the control of magnetism by
electric fields and by current-induced torques. We first review fundamental
concepts in these two directions, then discuss their combination, and finally
present various families of devices harnessing the electrical control of
magnetic properties for various application fields. We conclude by giving
perspectives in terms of both emerging fundamental physics concepts and new
directions in materials science.

physical phenomena allowing for the control of the orientation are interpreted
in terms of the frequencies contributing to the field-dressed dynamics and to
the driving field by a spectral analysis.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We design an algorithm that efficiently generates each of $2^n+1$ quantum
circuits capable of producing $2^n+1$ mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) on
$n$-qubit systems with $O(n^3)$ time complexity. These circuits consist of a
maximum of $(n^2+7n)/2$ $H$, $S$, and $CZ$ gates, structured as $-H-S-CZ-$.
Alternatively, each circuit can be implemented using $H^{\otimes n}$ and a
diagonal operation. On average, the count of $S$ gates, $CZ$ gates, and $CZ$
gates with distance $u$ in each nontrivial circuit amounts to $3n/2$,
$(n^2-n)/4$, and $(n-u)/2$, respectively. Moreover, we've observed that the
entanglement segment comprises $2n-3$ fixed modules, and the $2^n$ nontrivial
circuits satisfy some intriguing ``linear" relations.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We propose a simple design of a quantum electron microscope that ``queries''
a beam-sensitive phase object, such as a biological specimen, as part of
quantum computation. Lower quantum query complexity, not the time complexity,
of a quantum algorithm means less specimen damage, which translates to more
data extracted from the specimen. Hence small-scale quantum computing offers
provable quantum advantage in this context. A possible application of the
proposed microscope is the Grover search for a true structure, out of a set of
candidate structures.

  Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage, a very efficient technique for
manipulating a quantum system based on the adiabatic theorem, is analyzed in
the case where the manipulated physical system is interacting with a spin bath.
Exploitation of the rotating wave approximation allows for the identification
of a constant of motion which simplifies both the analytical and the numerical
treatment, which allows for evaluating the total unitary evolution of system
and bath. The efficiency of the population transfer process is investigated in
several regimes, including the weak and strong coupling with the environment
and the off-resonance. The formation of appropriate Zeno subspaces explains the
lowering of the efficiency in the strong damping regime.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum key distribution (QKD) networks are expected to enable
information-theoretical secure (ITS) communication over a large-scale network.
Most researches on relay-based QKD network assume that all relays or nodes are
completely trustworthy. However, the malicious behavior of any single node can
undermine security of QKD networks. Current research on Quantum Key
Distribution (QKD) networks primarily addresses passive attacks, such as
eavesdropping, conducted by malicious nodes. Although there are proposed
solutions like majority voting and secret sharing for point-to-point QKD
systems to counter active attacks, these strategies are not directly
transferable to QKD network research due to different security requirements. We
propose the a new paradigm for the security requirements of QKD networks and
addresses the active attack by collaborate malicious nodes. Firstly, regarding
security, we introduce the ITS distributed authentication scheme, which
additionally offers two crucial security properties to QKD networks: identity
unforgeability and non-repudiation. Secondly, concerning correctness, we
propose an ITS fault-tolerant consensus scheme based on our ITS distributed
authentication to ensure global consistency, enabling participating nodes to
collaborate correctly in a more practical manner. Through our simulation, we
have shown that our scheme exhibits a significantly lower growth trend in key
consumption compared to the original pre-shared keys scheme. For instance, in
larger networks such as when the nodes number is 80, our scheme's key
consumption is only 13.1\% of the pre-shared keys scheme.

**The dissipative Generalized Hydrodynamic equations and their numerical solution**—2022-12-23 (updated: 2023-11-20)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12349v2)]<br/>Frederik Møller, Nicolas Besse, Igor E. Mazets, Hans-Peter Stimming, Norbert J. Mauser
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  "Generalized Hydrodynamics" (GHD) stands for a model that describes
one-dimensional \textit{integrable} systems in quantum physics, such as
ultra-cold atoms or spin chains. Mathematically, GHD corresponds to nonlinear
equations of kinetic type, where the main unknown, a statistical distribution
function $f(t,z,\theta)$, lives in a phase space which is constituted by a
one-dimensional position variable $z$, and a one-dimensional "kinetic" variable
$\theta$, actually a wave-vector, called "rapidity". Two key features of GHD
equations are first a non-local and nonlinear coupling in the advection term,
and second an infinite set of conserved quantities, which prevent the system
from thermalizing. To go beyond this, we consider the dissipative GHD
equations, which are obtained by supplementing the right-hand side of the GHD
equations with a non-local and nonlinear diffusion operator or a Boltzmann-type
collision integral. In this paper, we deal with new high-order numerical
methods to efficiently solve these kinetic equations. In particular, we devise
novel backward semi-Lagrangian methods for solving the advective part (the
so-called Vlasov equation) by using a high-order time-Taylor series expansion
for the advection fields, whose successive time derivatives are obtained by a
recursive procedure. This high-order temporal approximation of the advection
fields are used to design new implicit/explicit Runge-Kutta semi-Lagrangian
methods, which are compared to Adams-Moulton semi-Lagrangian schemes. For
solving the source terms, constituted by the diffusion and collision operators,
we use and compare different numerical methods of the literature.

  The challenge to achieve practical quantum computing considering current

cross-talk, error mitigation can push the boundary of practical quantum
computing. This has been accomplished using Sparse Pauli-Lindblad models only
on devices with a linear topology connectivity (i.e. superconducting qubit
devices). In this work we extend the theoretical requirement for learning such
noise models on hardware with full connectivity (i.e. ion trap devices).

  A detection scheme is explored for light dark matter, such as axion dark
matter or dark photon dark matter, using a Paul ion trap system. We first
demonstrate that a qubit, constructed from the ground and first excited states
of vibrational modes of ions in a Paul trap, can serve as an effective sensor
for weak electric fields due to its resonant excitation. As a consequence, a
Paul ion trap allows us to search for weak electric fields induced by light
dark matter with masses around the neV range. Furthermore, we illustrate that
an entangled qubit system involving $N$ ions can enhance the excitation rate by
a factor of $N^2$. The sensitivities of the Paul ion trap system to
axion-photon coupling and gauge kinetic mixing can reach previously unexplored
parameter space.

**Nav-Q: Quantum Deep Reinforcement Learning for Collision-Free Navigation of Self-Driving Cars**—2023-11-20—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12875v1)]<br/>Akash Sinha, Antonio Macaluso, Matthias Klusch
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The challenge of collision-free navigation (CFN) for self-driving cars is an
NP-hard problem addressed through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Despite
the effectiveness of DRL methods, their application demands significant
computing resources and prolonged training periods to establish a resilient
agent. On the other hand, quantum reinforcement learning algorithms have
recently demonstrated faster convergence and improved stability in simple,
non-real-world environments. However, their application in the real-world CFN
domain has not been explored, and their direct adaptation would require a
quantum computing device onboard the vehicle for testing.
  In this work, we propose Nav-Q, the first quantum-supported DRL algorithm for
CFN of self-driving cars, that leverages quantum computation for improving the
training performance without the requirement for onboard quantum hardware.
Nav-Q is based on the actor-critic approach, where the critic is implemented
using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm suitable for near-term quantum
devices. We assess the performance of Nav-Q using the CARLA driving simulator,
a de facto standard benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art DRL methods. Our
empirical evaluations showcase that Nav-Q surpasses its classical counterpart
not only in terms of training stability but also, in certain instances, with
respect to the convergence rate when analyzing the Reward vs. Episode curve.
This enhancement is accomplished without negatively impacting the learned
policy by the agent. Furthermore, we assess Nav-Q in relation to effective
dimension, unveiling that the incorporation of a quantum component results in a
model possessing greater descriptive power compared to classical baselines.
Finally, we evaluate the performance of Nav-Q using noisy quantum simulation,
observing that the quantum noise enhances the exploratory tendencies of the
agent during training.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The optimization of the power consumption of antenna networks is a problem
with a potential impact in the field of telecommunications. In this work, we
investigate the application of quantum algorithms to the solution of a
simplified model in this field using a statevector emulator. Specifically, we
apply the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and the quantum
adiabatic algorithm (QAA) to the antenna placement problem. We compare these
two algorithms in terms of solution quality by means of selected evaluation
metrics such as the approximation ratio, the probability of the exact solution,
and the cumulative probability of cost-effective solutions.We corroborate
previous observations that QAA exhibits better performances when arbitrarily
deep circuits are allowed, while QAOA performs better at low depths. Both
approaches in principle correctly identify the solution to the problem at a
sufficiently large depth. However, they suffer from an exponential decrease of
the probability of the exact state, as the system size increases. This issue is
particularly severe when we include soft constraints in the problem, resulting
in an effective full connectivity between the antennas. Our results suggest
that the low probability of measuring an acceptable solution is a potential
bottleneck in the application of these two algorithms to industrial problems at
scales relevant to practical applications.

Pure Quantum (TPQ) state approach and apply the Quantum Imaginary Time
Evolution (QITE) algorithm to implement the necessary imaginary time evolution.
We first compute the chiral condensate in the massless Schwinger model,
verifying its consistency with the analytical solution. We then simulate the
massive Schwinger model with non-zero topological $\theta$-term to investigate
the temperature and $\theta$-dependence of the chiral condensate. Our method
works well even at non-zero $\theta$ regime, while the conventional lattice
Monte Carlo method suffers from the sign problem in this system.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  A theoretical particle-number conserving quantum field theory based on the
concept of imaginary time is presented and applied to the scenario of a
coherent atomic laser field at ultra-cold temperatures. The proposed
theoretical model describes the analytical derivation of the frequency comb
spectrum for an atomic laser realized from modeling a coherent atomic beam of
condensate and non-condensate quantum field components released from a trapped
Bose-Einstein condensate at a given repetition phase and frequency. The
condensate part of the atomic vapor is assumed to be subjected to thermal noise
induced by the temperature of the surrounding thermal atomic cloud. This new
quantum approach uses time periodicity and an orthogonal decomposition of the
quantum field in a complex-valued quantum field representation to derive and
model the quantum field's forward- and backward-propagating components as a
standing wave field in the same unique time and temperature domain without
quantitative singularities at finite temperatures. The complex-valued atom
laser field, the resulting frequency comb, and the repetition frequency
distribution with the varying shape of envelopes are numerically monitored
within a Monte-Carlo sampling method, as a function of temperature and trap
frequency of the external confinement.

  Mathematical representations of graphs often resemble adjacency matrices or
lists, representations that facilitate whiteboard reasoning and algorithm
design. In the realm of proof assistants, inductive representations effectively
define semantics for formal reasoning. This highlights a gap where algorithm
design and proof assistants require a fundamentally different structure of
graphs, particularly for process theories which represent programs using
graphs. To address this gap, we present VyZX, a verified library for reasoning
about inductively defined graphical languages. These inductive constructs arise
naturally from category theory definitions. A key goal for VyZX is to Verify
the ZX-calculus, a graphical language for reasoning about quantum computation.
The ZX-calculus comes with a collection of diagrammatic rewrite rules that
preserve the graph's semantic interpretation. We show how inductive graphs in
VyZX are used to prove the correctness of the ZX-calculus rewrite rules and
apply them in practice using standard proof assistant techniques. VyZX
integrates easily with the proof engineer's workflow through visualization and
automation.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The quantum antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice offers an archetypal
frustrated system, which potentially realizes a quantum spin liquid
characterized by the absence of standard spontaneous symmetry breaking even at
zero temperature, unusually as an isotropic 3D system. Despite tremendous
progress in the literature, however, the nature of the ground state of the
fully quantum-mechanical spin Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice still
remains elusive. Here, we show that an unconventional type of quantum spin
liquid is born out from the pyrochlore system after the self-organized
dimensional reduction leading to confined states in 2D layers. This conclusion
is obtained from state-of-the-art variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulations at
zero temperature. Quantum spin liquids triggered by the emergent dimensional
reduction is an unexplored route of the spin-liquid formation. The dimensional
reduction from 3D to 2D is a consequence of a conventional spontaneous symmetry
breaking, while the resultant decoupling of layers enables the emergence of a
2D quantum spin liquid that is adiabatically disconnected from trivial product
states and exhibits strong quantum entanglement. The stabilized quantum spin
liquid exhibits an algebraic decay of correlations and vanishing excitation gap
in the thermodynamic limit. The wave-function structure supports the
fractionalization of the spin into spinons. This spin-liquid ground state
persists in the presence of spin-orbit interactions, which expands the
possibilities of realizing quantum spin liquids in real pyrochlore-structured
materials.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are excellent luminescent
nanomaterials for a broad range of optoelectronic applications. Their
photoluminescence blinking, however, hinders their practical use in many
aspects. It has been shown that coupling QDs to plasmonic nanostructures may
provide a viable way to suppress blinking. Nevertheless, the underlying
mechanism of blinking suppression remains unclear and debated. Here, by
deterministically coupling a single QD to a plasmonic nanocavity, we clarify
the mechanism of blinking suppression, and demonstrate unprecedentedly bright
emission from a single colloidal QD. In particular, we report for the first
time that the coupled system exhibits nonblinking photoluminescence with
blinking lifetime, which shows that the elimination of photoluminescence
blinking originates from enhanced quantum yield of the charged states. We
identify that the radiative decay rate is boosted from (48 ns)-1 to (0.7 ns)-1,
which outcompetes Auger processes and enables similar quantum yields for
charged and neutral excitons. Moreover, we demonstrate ultrabright
photoluminescence of up to 17 million detected photons per second from a single
QD. This work sheds new light on the goal of achieving ultrabright nonblinking
QDs and may benefit a variety of QD-based applications.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  According to the AdS/CFT dictionary, adding a relevant double-trace
deformation $f\int O^2$ to a holographic CFT action is dual to imposing mixed
Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions for the field dual to $O$ in AdS. We
observed similar behaviour in codimension-two flat space holographies. We
consider deformations of boundary conditions in flat spacetimes under flat
space co-dimension-two holographies, celestial holography and Wedge-like
holography. In the former celestial-holographic approach, we imposed boundary
conditions on initial and final bulk states in the scattering. We find that
these non-trivial boundary conditions in the bulk induce ``double deformations"
on the Celestial CFT side, which can be understood as an analogy of double
trace deformations in the usual AdS/CFT. We compute two-point bulk scattering
amplitudes under the non-trivial deformed boundary conditions. In the latter
Wedge-like holography approach, we consider mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary
conditions on the null infinity of the light-cone. We find that this mixing
induces a renormalization flow in the dual Wedge CFT side under the Wedge
holography, as in the usual AdS/CFT. We argue that the discrepancy between the
Wedge two-point function and the Celestial two-point function originates from a
sensitivity of bulk massless fields to a regularization parameter to use the
usual AdS/CFT techniques.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  State transformation problems such as compressing quantum information or
breaking quantum commitments are fundamental quantum tasks. However, their
computational difficulty cannot easily be characterized using traditional
complexity theory, which focuses on tasks with classical inputs and outputs.
  To study the complexity of such state transformation tasks, we introduce a
framework for unitary synthesis problems, including notions of reductions and
unitary complexity classes. We use this framework to study the complexity of
transforming one entangled state into another via local operations. We
formalize this as the Uhlmann Transformation Problem, an algorithmic version of
Uhlmann's theorem. Then, we prove structural results relating the complexity of
the Uhlmann Transformation Problem, polynomial space quantum computation, and
zero knowledge protocols.
  The Uhlmann Transformation Problem allows us to characterize the complexity
of a variety of tasks in quantum information processing, including decoding
noisy quantum channels, breaking falsifiable quantum cryptographic assumptions,
implementing optimal prover strategies in quantum interactive proofs, and
decoding the Hawking radiation of black holes. Our framework for unitary
complexity thus provides new avenues for studying the computational complexity
of many natural quantum information processing tasks.

**Motional decoherence in ultracold Rydberg atom quantum simulators of spin models**—2022-01-20 (updated: 2023-11-20)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08463v4)]<br/>Zewen Zhang, Ming Yuan, Bhuvanesh Sundar, Kaden R. A. Hazzard
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Ultracold Rydberg atom arrays are an emerging platform for quantum simulation
and computing. However, decoherence in these systems remains incompletely
understood. Recent experiments [Guardado-Sanchez et al. Phys. Rev. X 8, 021069
(2018)] observed strong decoherence in the quench and longitudinal-field-sweep
dynamics of two-dimensional Ising models realized with Lithium-6 Rydberg atoms
in optical lattices. This decoherence was conjectured to arise from spin-motion
coupling. Here we show that spin-motion coupling indeed leads to decoherence in
qualitative, and often quantitative, agreement with the experimental data,
treating the difficult spin-motion coupled problem using the discrete truncated
Wigner approximation method. We also show that this decoherence will be an
important factor to account for in future experiments with Rydberg atoms in
optical lattices and microtrap arrays, and discuss methods to mitigate the
effect of motion, such as using heavier atoms or deeper traps.

**A Case for Synthesis of Recursive Quantum Unitary Programs**—2023-11-20—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11503v1)]<br/>Haowei Deng, Runzhou Tao, Yuxiang Peng, Xiaodi Wu
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum programs are notoriously difficult to code and verify due to
unintuitive quantum knowledge associated with quantum programming. Automated
tools relieving the tedium and errors associated with low-level quantum details
would hence be highly desirable. In this paper, we initiate the study of
program synthesis for quantum unitary programs that recursively define a family
of unitary circuits for different input sizes, which are widely used in
existing quantum programming languages. Specifically, we present QSynth, the
first quantum program synthesis framework, including a new inductive quantum
programming language, its specification, a sound logic for reasoning, and an
encoding of the reasoning procedure into SMT instances. By leveraging existing
SMT solvers, QSynth successfully synthesizes ten quantum unitary programs
including quantum adder circuits, quantum eigenvalue inversion circuits and
Quantum Fourier Transformation, which can be readily transpiled to executable
programs on major quantum platforms, e.g., Q#, IBM Qiskit, and AWS Braket.

**Robust and efficient verification of graph states in blind measurement-based quantum computation**—2023-05-18 (updated: 2023-11-20)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10742v2)]<br/>Zihao Li, Huangjun Zhu, Masahito Hayashi
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Blind quantum computation (BQC) is a secure quantum computation method that
protects the privacy of clients. Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC)
is a promising approach for realizing BQC. To obtain reliable results in blind
MBQC, it is crucial to verify whether the resource graph states are accurately
prepared in the adversarial scenario. However, previous verification protocols
for this task are too resource consuming or noise susceptible to be applied in
practice. Here, we propose a robust and efficient protocol for verifying
arbitrary graph states with any prime local dimension in the adversarial
scenario, which leads to a robust and efficient protocol for verifying the
resource state in blind MBQC. Our protocol requires only local Pauli
measurements and is thus easy to realize with current technologies.
Nevertheless, it can achieve the optimal scaling behaviors with respect to the
system size and the target precision as quantified by the infidelity and
significance level, which has never been achieved before. Notably, our protocol
can exponentially enhance the scaling behavior with the significance level.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  A quantum-limited amplifier enables the amplification of weak signals while
introducing minimal noise dictated by the principles of quantum mechanics.
These amplifiers serve a broad spectrum of applications in quantum computing,
including fast and accurate readout of superconducting qubits and spins, as
well as various uses in quantum sensing and metrology. Parametric
amplification, primarily developed using Josephson junctions, has evolved into
the leading technology for highly effective microwave measurements within
quantum circuits. Despite their significant contributions, these amplifiers
face fundamental limitations, such as their inability to handle high powers,
sensitivity to parasitic magnetic fields, and particularly their limitation to
operate only at millikelvin temperatures. To tackle these challenges, here we
experimentally develop a novel quantum-limited amplifier based on
superconducting kinetic inductance and present an extensive theoretical model
to describe this nonlinear coupled-mode system. Our device surpasses the
conventional constraints associated with Josephson junction amplifiers by
operating at much higher temperatures up to 4.5 K. With two distinct spectral
modes and tunability through bias current, this amplifier can operate
selectively in both single and double-mode amplification regimes near the
quantum noise limit. Utilizing a nonlinear thin film exhibiting kinetic
inductance, our device attains gain exceeding 50 dB in a single-mode and 32 dB
in a double-mode configuration while adding 0.35 input-referred quanta of
noise. Importantly, this amplifier eliminates the need for Josephson junctions,
resulting in significantly higher power handling capabilities than
Josephson-based amplifiers. It also demonstrates resilience in the presence of
magnetic fields, offers a straightforward design, and enhances reliability.

**Solve single photon detector problems**—2022-03-06 (updated: 2023-11-20)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02905v7)]<br/>Hao Shu
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Single photon detector(SPD) problems arise in most quantum tasks, especially
for measuring states going through high-lost channels. They are particularly
prominent in quantum key distribution(QKD), which could be the most significant
application in quantum information theory. In recent years, QKD distance has
been improved dramatically but is still restricted because the bit error
rate(QBER) caused by SPD dark counts will be out of control as the distance
increases. If this problem can be solved, QKD can be implemented over
arbitrarily long distances. However, previous solutions often result in
impractical requirements such as superconductors while they can only reduce the
dark count rate to finite low levels. In this paper, we solve SPD problems with
today's technologies only. Although it is the no-cloning theorem that prevents
a state from being measured multiple times to obtain a more reliable result, we
propose a scheme circumventing the no-cloning theorem in certain tasks to allow
a single state to be employed several times. The scheme demonstrates that
imperfect detectors can provide nearly perfect results, namely, the QBER caused
by dark counts can be reduced to arbitrarily low while in the meantime,
detective efficiency can be improved to arbitrarily high. Consequently, QKD
distance is not limited by the imperfect SPD anymore and can be improved from
hundreds of kilometers to thousands without high-technology detectors.
Furthermore, similar schemes can be applied for reducing measurement errors or
improving the performance of sources. Finally, it is worth noting that although
the paper is mainly discussed in the context of QKD, our scheme is an
independent scheme that could be employed in other protocols wherever SPD are
employed.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The ability to engineer entangled states that involve macroscopic objects is
of particular importance for a wide variety of quantum-enabled technologies,
ranging from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. Here we propose
how to achieve coherent manipulation and enhancement of quantum entanglement in
a hybrid optomechanical system, which consists of a Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity with
two movable mirrors, an optical parametric amplifier (OPA), and an injected
squeezed vacuum reservoir. We show that the advantages of this system are
twofold: (i) one can effectively regulate the light-mirror interactions by
introducing a squeezed intracavity mode via the OPA; (ii) when properly
matching the squeezing parameters between the squeezed cavity mode and the
injected squeezed vacuum reservoir, the optical input noises can be suppressed
completely. These peculiar features of this system allow us to generate and
manipulate quantum entanglement in a coherent and controllable way. More
importantly, we also find that such controllable entanglement, under some
specific squeezing parameters, can be considerably enhanced in comparison with
those of the conventional optomechanical system. Our work, providing a
promising method to regulate and tailor the light-mirror interaction, are
poised to serve as a useful tool for engineering various quantum effects which
are based on cavity optomechanics.

**Decoherence from Horizons: General Formulation and Rotating Black Holes**—2023-11-19—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11461v1)]<br/>Samuel E. Gralla, Hongji Wei
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Recent work by Danielson, Satishchandran, and Wald (DSW) has shown that black
holes -- and, in fact, Killing horizons more generally -- impart a fundamental
rate of decoherence on all nearby quantum superpositions. The effect can be
understood from measurement and causality: An observer (Bob) in the black hole
should be able to disturb outside quantum superpositions by measuring their
superposed gravitational fields, but since his actions cannot (by causality)
have this effect, the superpositions must automatically disturb themselves. DSW
calculated the rate of decoherence up to an unknown numerical factor for
distant observers in Schwarzschild spacetime, Rindler observers in flat
spacetime, and static observers in de Sitter spacetime. Working in
electromagnetic and Klein-Gordon analogs, we flesh out and generalize their
calculation to derive a general formula for the precise decoherence rate for
Killing observers near bifurcate Killing horizons. We evaluate the rate in
closed form for an observer at an arbitrary location on the symmetry axis of a
Kerr black hole. This fixes the numerical factor in the distant-observer
Schwarzschild result, while allowing new exploration of near-horizon and/or
near-extremal behavior. In the electromagnetic case we find that the
decoherence vanishes entirely in the extremal limit, due to the "Black hole
Meissner effect" screening the Coulomb field from entering the black hole. This
supports the causality picture: Since Bob is unable to measure the field of the
outside superposition, no decoherence is necessary -- and indeed none occurs.

**Obfuscation of Pseudo-Deterministic Quantum Circuits**—2023-02-22 (updated: 2023-11-19)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11083v3)]<br/>James Bartusek, Fuyuki Kitagawa, Ryo Nishimaki, Takashi Yamakawa
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We show how to obfuscate pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits in the
classical oracle model, assuming the quantum hardness of learning with errors.
Given the classical description of a quantum circuit $Q$, our obfuscator
outputs a quantum state $\ket{\widetilde{Q}}$ that can be used to evaluate $Q$
repeatedly on arbitrary inputs.
  Instantiating the classical oracle using any candidate post-quantum
indistinguishability obfuscator gives us the first candidate construction of
indistinguishability obfuscation for all polynomial-size pseudo-deterministic
quantum circuits. In particular, our scheme is the first candidate obfuscator
for a class of circuits that is powerful enough to implement Shor's algorithm
(SICOMP 1997).
  Our approach follows Bartusek and Malavolta (ITCS 2022), who obfuscate
\emph{null} quantum circuits by obfuscating the verifier of an appropriate
classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) scheme. We go beyond null
circuits by constructing a publicly-verifiable CVQC scheme for quantum
\emph{partitioning} circuits, which can be used to verify the evaluation
procedure of Mahadev's quantum fully-homomorphic encryption scheme (FOCS 2018).
We achieve this by upgrading the one-time secure scheme of Bartusek (TCC 2021)
to a fully reusable scheme, via a publicly-decodable \emph{Pauli functional
commitment}, which we formally define and construct in this work. This
commitment scheme, which satisfies a notion of binding against committers that
can access the receiver's standard and Hadamard basis decoding functionalities,
is constructed by building on techniques of Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, and
Zhandry (STOC 2020) introduced in the context of equivocal but
collision-resistant hash functions.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this paper, we study the ground state Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) in
one-dimensional spin-1 models, as witness to Multipartite Entanglement. The
models addressed are the Bilinear-Biquadratic model, the most general isotropic
SU(2)-invariant spin-1 chain, and the XXZ spin-1 chain, both with
nearest-neighbor interactions and open boundary conditions. We show that the
scaling of the QFI of strictly non-local observables can be used for
characterizing the phase diagrams and, in particular, for studying topological
phases, where it scales maximally. Analysing its behavior at the critical
phases we are also able to recover the scaling dimensions of the order
parameters both for local and string observables. The numerical results have
been obtained by exploiting the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm
and Tensor Network techniques.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We describe simulations of the quantum dynamics of a confocal cavity QED
system that realizes an intrinsically driven-dissipative spin glass. A close
connection between open quantum dynamics and replica symmetry breaking is
established, in which individual quantum trajectories are the replicas. We
observe that entanglement plays an important role in the emergence of replica
symmetry breaking in a fully connected, frustrated spin network of up to
fifteen spin-1/2 particles. Quantum trajectories of entangled spins reach
steady-state spin configurations of lower energy than that of semiclassical
trajectories. Cavity emission allows monitoring of the continuous stochastic
evolution of spin configurations, while backaction from this projects entangled
states into states of broken Ising and replica symmetry. The emergence of spin
glass order manifests itself through the simultaneous absence of magnetization
and the presence of nontrivial spin overlap density distributions among
replicas. Moreover, these overlaps reveal incipient ultrametric order, in line
with the Parisi RSB solution ansatz for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. A
nonthermal Parisi order parameter distribution, however, highlights the
driven-dissipative nature of this quantum optical spin glass. This practicable
system could serve as a testbed for exploring how quantum effects enrich the
physics of spin glasses.

**Enhancement of photon blockade via topological edge states**—2023-11-19—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11431v1)]<br/>Jun Li, Can-ming Hu, Yaping Yang
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum technologies, holding the promise of exponentially superior
performance than their classical counterparts for certain tasks, have
consistently encountered challenges, including instability in quantum light
sources, quantum decoherence and vulnerability to losses that topological
photonics happens to adeptly address. Here, we theoretically put forth a
quantum Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type chain designed to greatly enhance
single-photon blockade (single-PB) effect with topological protection. By
designing the deliberate coupling strengths, the quantum-level lattices take
the form of a one-dimensional array with a topological edge state in
single-excitation space and a two-dimensional square breathing lattice with
topological corner states in two-excitation space, resulting in enhanced
single-photon excitation and the suppression of two-photon transitions.
Therefore the second-order correlation function is diminished by up to two
orders of magnitude at the cavity resonance frequency, accompanied by stronger
brightness.Furthermore, the PB effect is robust to local perturbations in
cavity-qubit coupling and qubit frequency, benefitting from topological
protection.

  We propose that the universe contains two identical sets of particles and
gauge interactions, coupling only through gravitation, which differ by their
Higgs potentials. We postulate that because of underlying symmetries, the two
sectors when uncoupled have Higgs potentials that lie at the boundary between
phases with nonzero and zero Higgs vacuum expectation. Turning on the coupling
between the two sectors can break the degeneracy, pushing the Higgs potential
in one sector into the domain of nonzero Higgs expectation (giving the visible
sector), and pushing the Higgs potential in the other sector into the domain of
zero Higgs expectation (giving the dark sector). The least massive baryon in
the dark sector will then be a candidate self-interacting dark matter particle.

  Quantum embedding is indispensable for applying quantum machine learning
techniques to classical data, and has substantial impacts on performance
outcomes. In this study, we present Neural Quantum Embedding (NQE), a method
that efficiently optimizes quantum embedding by leveraging classical deep
learning techniques. NQE enhances the lower bound of the empirical risk,
leading to substantial improvements in classification performance. Moreover,
NQE improves robustness against noise. To validate the effectiveness of NQE, we
conduct experiments on IBM quantum devices for image data classification,
resulting in a remarkable accuracy enhancement from 0.52 to 0.96. Numerical
analysis of the local effective dimension highlights that NQE improves the
trainability and generalization performance of quantum neural networks.
Furthermore, NQE achieves improved generalization in the quantum kernel method,
as evidenced by a reduction in the upper bound of the expected risk.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Classical data encoding is usually treated as a black-box in the oracle-based
quantum algorithms. On the other hand, their constructions are crucial for
practical algorithm implementations. Here, we open the black-boxes of data
encoding and study the Clifford$+T$ complexity of constructing some typical
quantum access models. For general matrices, we show that both sparse-access
input models and block-encoding require nearly linear circuit complexities
relative to the matrix dimension, even if matrices are sparse. We also gives
construction protocols achieving near-optimal gate complexities. On the other
hand, the construction becomes efficient with respect to the data qubit when
the matrix is the linear combination polynomial terms of efficient unitaries.
As a typical example, we propose improved block encoding when these unitaries
are Pauli strings. Our protocols are built upon improved quantum state
preparation and a selective oracle for Pauli strings, which hold independent
value. Our access model constructions offer considerable flexibility, allowing
for tunable ancillary qubit number and offers corresponding space-time
trade-offs.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Machine learning techniques are essential tools to compute efficient, yet
accurate, force fields for atomistic simulations. This approach has recently
been extended to incorporate quantum computational methods, making use of
variational quantum learning models to predict potential energy surfaces and
atomic forces from ab initio training data. However, the trainability and
scalability of such models are still limited, due to both theoretical and
practical barriers. Inspired by recent developments in geometric classical and
quantum machine learning, here we design quantum neural networks that
explicitly incorporate, as a data-inspired prior, an extensive set of
physically relevant symmetries. We find that our invariant quantum learning
models outperform their more generic counterparts on individual molecules of
growing complexity. Furthermore, we study a water dimer as a minimal example of
a system with multiple components, showcasing the versatility of our proposed
approach and opening the way towards larger simulations. Our results suggest
that molecular force fields generation can significantly profit from leveraging
the framework of geometric quantum machine learning, and that chemical systems
represent, in fact, an interesting and rich playground for the development and
application of advanced quantum machine learning tools.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We investigate the nonequilibrium steady state of the anisotropic open
quantum Rabi model, which exhibits first-order and second-order dissipative
phase transitions upon varying the degree of anisotropy between the coupling
strengths of rotating and counterrotating terms. Using both semiclassical and
quantum approaches, we find a rich phase diagram resulting from the interplay
between the anisotropy and the dissipation. First, there exists a bistable
phase where both the normal and superradiant phases are stable. Second, there
are multicritical points where the phase boundaries for the first- and
second-order phase transitions meet. We show that a new set of critical
exponents governs the scaling of the multicritical points. Finally, we discuss
the feasibility of observing the multicritical transitions and bistability
using a pair of trapped ions where the anisotropy can be tuned by the
controlling the intensity of the Raman transitions. Our study enlarges the
scope of critical phenomena that may occur in finite-component quantum systems,
which could be useful for the applications in the critical quantum sensing.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum machine learning (QML) represents a promising frontier in the quantum
technologies. In this pursuit of quantum advantage, the quantum kernel method
for support vector machine has emerged as a powerful approach. Entanglement, a
fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, assumes a central role in quantum
computing. In this paper, we investigate the optimal number of entanglement
gates in the quantum kernel feature maps by a multi-objective genetic
algorithm. We distinct the fitness functions of genetic algorithm for non-local
gates for entanglement and local gates to gain insights into the benefits of
employing entanglement gates. Our experiments reveal that the optimal
configuration of quantum circuits for the quantum kernel method incorporates a
proportional number of non-local gates for entanglement. The result complements
the prior literature on quantum kernel generation where non-local gates were
largely suppressed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the separability indexes
of data can be leveraged to estimate the number of non-local gates required for
the quantum support vector machine's feature maps. This insight can be helpful
in selecting appropriate parameters, such as the entanglement parameter, in
various quantum programming packages like https://qiskit.org/ based on data
analysis. Our findings offer valuable guidance for enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of quantum machine learning algorithms.

for different external drives and initial conditions, resulting
de-Gaussification throughout evolution. Furthermore, we also see that the

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Spin squeezing, as a crucial quantum resource, plays a pivotal role in
quantum metrology, enabling us to achieve high-precision parameter estimation
schemes. Here we investigate the spin squeezing and the quantum phase
transition in anisotropic central spin systems. We find that this kind of
central spin systems can be mapped to the anisotropic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
model in the limit where the ratio of transition frequencies between the
central spin and the spin bath tends towards infinity. This property can induce
a one-axis twisting interaction and provides a new possibility for generating
spin squeezing. We consider generating spin-squeezed states via the ground
state and the dynamic evolution of the central spin model. The results show
that the spin squeezing parameter improves as the anisotropy parameter
decreases, and its value scales with system size as $N^{-2/3}$. Furthermore, we
obtain the critical exponent of the quantum Fisher information around the
critical point by numerical simulation, and find this value tends to $4/3$ as
the frequency ratio and the system size approach infinity. This work offers a
promising scheme for generating spin-squeezed state and paves the way for
potential advancements in quantum sensing.

**Where does the Born Rule come from? Superposition**—2023-10-06 (updated: 2023-11-19)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04188v3)]<br/>David Ellerman
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The Born Rule plays a critical role in quantum mechanics (QM) since it
supplies the link between the mathematical formalism and experimental results
in terms of probabilities. The Born Rule does not occur in ordinary probability
theory. Where then does it come from? This has been a topic of considerable
controversy in the literature. We take the approach of asking what is the
simplest extension of ordinary probability theory where the Born rule appears.
This is answered by showing that the Born Rule appears by adding the notion of
superposition events (in addition to the ordinary discrete events) to finite
probability theory. Hence the rule does not need any physics-based derivation.
It is simply a feature of the mathematics of superposition when only
superposition events are added to ordinary probability theory.

  Steering is one of the three in-equivalent forms of nonlocal correlations
intermediate between Bell nonlocality and entanglement. Schrodinger-Robertson
uncertainty relation (SRUR), has been widely used to detect entanglement and
steering. However, the steering criterion in earlier works, based on SRUR, did
not involve complete inferred-variance uncertainty relation. In this paper, by
considering the local hidden state model and Reid formalism, we derive a
complete inferred-variance EPR-steering criterion based on SRUR in the
bipartite scenario. Furthermore, we check the effectiveness of our steering
criterion with discrete variable bipartite two-qubit and two-qutrit isotropic
states.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  For decades, most research on high harmonic generation (HHG) considered
matter as quantum but light as classical, leaving the quantum-optical nature of
the harmonics an open question. Here we explore the quantum properties of high
harmonics. We derive a formula for the quantum state of the high harmonics,
when driven by arbitrary quantum light states, and then explore specific cases
of experimental relevance. Specifically, for a moderately squeezed pump, HHG
driven by squeezed coherent light results in squeezed high harmonics. Harmonic
squeezing is optimized by syncing ionization times with the pump's squeezing
phase. Beyond this regime, as pump squeezing is increased, the harmonics
initially acquire squeezed thermal photon statistics, and then occupy an
intricate quantum state which strongly depends on the semi-classical nonlinear
response function of the interacting system. Our results pave the way for the
generation of squeezed extreme-ultraviolet ultrashort pulses, and, more
generally, quantum frequency conversion into previously inaccessible spectral
ranges, which may enable ultrasensitive attosecond metrology.

**Unconventional many-body phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Ising chain**—2023-11-19—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11251v1)]<br/>Chao-Ze Lu, Xiaolong Deng, Su-Peng Kou, Gaoyong Sun
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We study many-body phase transitions in a one-dimensional ferromagnetic
transversed field Ising model with an imaginary field and show that the system
exhibits three phase transitions: one second-order phase transition and two
$\mathcal{PT}$ phase transitions. The second-order phase transition occurring
in the ground state is investigated via biorthogonal and self-normal
entanglement entropy, for which we develop an approach to perform finite-size
scaling theory to extract the central charge for small systems. Compared with
the second-order phase transition, the first $\mathcal{PT}$ transition is
characterized by the appearance of an exceptional point in the full energy
spectrum, while the second $\mathcal{PT}$ transition only occurs in specific
excited states. Furthermore, we interestingly show that both of exceptional
points are second-order in terms of scalings of imaginary parts of the energy.
This work provides an exact solution for unconventional many-body phase
transitions in non-Hermitian systems.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum networks have experienced rapid advancements in both theoretical and
experimental domains over the last decade, making it increasingly important to
understand their large-scale features from the viewpoint of statistical
physics. This review paper discusses a fundamental question: how can
entanglement be effectively and indirectly (e.g., through intermediate nodes)
distributed between distant nodes in an imperfect quantum network, where the
connections are only partially entangled and subject to quantum noise? We
survey recent studies addressing this issue by drawing exact or approximate
mappings to percolation theory, a branch of statistical physics centered on
network connectivity. Notably, we show that the classical percolation
frameworks do not uniquely define the network's indirect connectivity. This
realization leads to the emergence of an alternative theory called
``concurrence percolation,'' which uncovers a previously unrecognized quantum
advantage that emerges at large scales, suggesting that quantum networks are
more resilient than initially assumed within classical percolation contexts,
offering refreshing insights into future quantum network design.

**Coherent postionization dynamics of molecules based on adiabatic strong-field approximation**—2023-11-19—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11242v1)]<br/>Shan Xue, Wenli Yang, Ping Li, Yuxuan Zhang, Pengji Ding, Song-Feng Zhao, Hongchuan Du, Anh-Thu Le
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Open-system density matrix methods typically employ incoherent population
injection to investigate the postionization dynamics in strong laser fields.
The presence of coherence injection has long been a subject of debate. In this
context, we introduce a coherence injection model based on the adiabatic
strong-field approximation (ASFA). This model effectively predicts ionic
coherence resulting from directional tunnel ionization. With increasing field
strength, the degree of coherence predicted by the ASFA model gradually
deviates from that of the SFA model but remains much milder compared to the
results of the simple and partial-wave expansion models. The impact of
coherence injection on the postionization molecular dynamics is explored in
O$_2$ and N$_2$. We find that the ionization-induced vibrational coherence
strongly enhances the population inversion of $X^2 \Sigma _g^+ -B^2 \Sigma _u^+
$ in N$_2^+$ and the dissociation probability of O$_2^+$. Conversely, the
ionization-induced vibronic coherences have inhibitory effects on the related
transitions. These findings reveal the significance of including the
vibronic-state-resolved coherence injection in simulating molecular dynamics
following strong-field ionization.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Contextuality is a key feature of quantum information that challenges
classical intuitions, providing the basis for constructing explicit proofs of
quantum advantage. While a number of evidences of quantum advantage are based
on the contextuality argument, the definition of contextuality is different in
each research, causing incoherence in the establishment of instant connection
between their results. In this report, we review the mathematical structure of
sheaf-theoretic contextuality and extend this framework to explain
Kochen-Specker type contextuality. We first cover the definitions in
contextuality with detailed examples. Then, we state the all-versus-nothing
(AvN) argument and define a state-independent AvN class. It is shown that
Kochen-Specker type contextuality, or contextuality in a partial closure, can
be translated into this framework by the partial closure of observables under
the multiplication of commuting measurements. Finally, we compare each case of
contextuality in an operator-side view, where the strict hierarchy of
contextuality class in a state-side view seems to merge into the
state-independent AvN class together with the partial closure formalism.
Overall, this report provides a unified interpretation of contextuality by
integrating Kochen-Specker type notions into the state-independent AvN
argument. The results present novel insights into contextuality, which pave the
way for a coherent approach to constructing proofs of quantum advantage.

  We introduce a general method to engineer arbitrary Hamiltonians in the
Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator, based on the
non-commutative Fourier transformation (NcFT) technique. We establish the
relationship between an arbitrary target Floquet Hamiltonian in phase space and
the periodic driving potential in real space. We obtain analytical expressions
for the driving potentials in real space that can generate novel Hamiltonians
in phase space, e.g., rotational lattices and sharp-boundary well. Our protocol
can be realised in a range of experimental platforms for nonclassical states

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Feedback control and erasure protocols have often been considered as a model
to embody Maxwell's Demon paradox and to study the interplay between
thermodynamics and information processing. Such studies have led to the
conclusion, now widely accepted in the community, that Maxwell's Demon and the
second law of thermodynamics can peacefully coexist because any gain provided
by the demon must be offset by the cost of performing measurement and resetting
the demon's memory to its initial state. Statements of this kind are
collectively referred to as second laws of information thermodynamics and have
recently been extended to include quantum theoretical scenarios. However,
previous studies in this direction have made several assumptions, in particular
about the feedback process and the measurement performed on the demon's memory,
and thus arrived at statements that are not universally applicable and whose
range of validity is not clear. In this work, we fill this gap by precisely
characterizing the full range of quantum feedback control and erasure protocols
that are overall consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. This leads
us to conclude that the second law of information thermodynamics is indeed
universal: it must hold for any quantum feedback control and erasure protocol,
regardless of the measurement process involved, as long as the protocol is
overall compatible with thermodynamics. Our comprehensive analysis not only
encompasses new scenarios but also retrieves previous ones, doing so with fewer
assumptions. This simplification contributes to a clearer understanding of the
theory. Additionally, our work identifies the Groenewold--Ozawa information
gain as the correct information measure characterizing the work extractable by
feedback control.

**SimuQ: A Framework for Programming Quantum Hamiltonian Simulation with Analog Compilation**—2023-03-05 (updated: 2023-11-19)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02775v3)]<br/>Yuxiang Peng, Jacob Young, Pengyu Liu, Xiaodi Wu
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum Hamiltonian simulation, which simulates the evolution of quantum
systems and probes quantum phenomena, is one of the most promising applications
of quantum computing. Recent experimental results suggest that
Hamiltonian-oriented analog quantum simulation would be advantageous over
circuit-oriented digital quantum simulation in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) machine era. However, programming analog quantum simulators is
much more challenging due to the lack of a unified interface between hardware
and software. In this paper, we design and implement SimuQ, the first framework
for quantum Hamiltonian simulation that supports Hamiltonian programming and
pulse-level compilation to heterogeneous analog quantum simulators.
Specifically, in SimuQ, front-end users specify the target quantum system with
Hamiltonian Modeling Language, and the Hamiltonian-level programmability of
analog quantum simulators is specified through a new abstraction called the
abstract analog instruction set (AAIS) and programmed in AAIS Specification
Language by hardware providers. Through a solver-based compilation, SimuQ
generates executable pulse schedules for real devices to simulate the evolution
of desired quantum systems, which is demonstrated on superconducting (IBM),
neutral-atom (QuEra), and trapped-ion (IonQ) quantum devices. Moreover, we
demonstrate the advantages of exposing the Hamiltonian-level programmability of
devices with native operations or interaction-based gates and establish a small
benchmark of quantum simulation to evaluate SimuQ's compiler with the above
analog quantum simulators.

**Generation of a coherent squeezed like state defined with the Lie-Trotter product formula using a nonlinear photonic crystal**—2023-04-22 (updated: 2023-11-19)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11373v3)]<br/>Hiroo Azuma
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this paper, we investigate how to generate coherent squeezed like light
using a nonlinear photonic crystal. Because the photonic crystal reduces the
group velocity of the incident light, if it is composed of a material with a
second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$, the interaction
between the nonlinear material and the light passing through it strengthens and
the quantum state of the emitted light is largely squeezed. Thus, we can
generate a coherent squeezed like light with a resonating cavity in which the
nonlinear photonic crystal is placed. This coherent squeezed like state is
defined with the Lie-Trotter product formula and its mathematical expression is
different from those of conventional coherent squeezed states. We show that we
can obtain this coherent squeezed like state with a squeezing level $15.9$ dB
practically by adjusting physical parameters for our proposed method. Feeding
the squeezed light whose average number of photons is given by one or two into
a beam splitter and splitting the flow of the squeezed light into a pair of
entangled light beams, we estimate their entanglement quantitatively. This
paper is a sequel to H. Azuma, J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 55, 315106 (2022).

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Grating magneto-optical traps are an enabling quantum technology for portable
metrological devices with ultracold atoms. However, beam diffraction efficiency
and angle are affected by wavelength, creating a single-optic design challenge
for laser cooling in two stages at two distinct wavelengths - as commonly used
for loading e.g. Sr or Yb atoms into optical lattice or tweezer clocks. Here,
we optically characterize a wide variety of binary gratings at different
wavelengths to find a simple empirical fit to experimental grating diffraction
efficiency data in terms of dimensionless etch depth and period for various
duty cycles. The model avoids complex 3D light-grating surface calculations,
yet still yields results accurate to a few percent across a broad range of
parameters. Gratings optimized for two (or more) wavelengths can now be
designed in an informed manner suitable for a wide class of atomic species
enabling advanced quantum technologies.

**Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Quantum Error Correction**—2023-11-18—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11167v1)]<br/>Tim Fu, Yue Zhao
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is one of the fundamental problems in quantum
computer systems, which aims to detect and correct errors in the data qubits
within quantum computers. Due to the presence of unreliable data qubits in
existing quantum computers, implementing quantum error correction is a critical
step when establishing a stable quantum computer system. Recently, machine
learning (ML)-based approaches have been proposed to address this challenge.
However, they lack a thorough understanding of quantum error correction. To
bridge this research gap, we provide a new perspective to understand machine
learning-based QEC in this paper. We find that syndromes in the ancilla qubits
result from errors on connected data qubits, and distant ancilla qubits can
provide auxiliary information to rule out some incorrect predictions for the
data qubits. Therefore, to detect errors in data qubits, we must consider the
information present in the long-range ancilla qubits. To the best of our
knowledge, machine learning is less explored in the dependency relationship of
QEC. To fill the blank, we curate a machine learning benchmark to assess the
capacity to capture long-range dependencies for quantum error correction. To
provide a comprehensive evaluation, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art deep
learning algorithms spanning diverse neural network architectures, such as
convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and graph transformers.
Our exhaustive experiments reveal an enlightening trend: By enlarging the
receptive field to exploit information from distant ancilla qubits, the
accuracy of QEC significantly improves. For instance, U-Net can improve CNN by
a margin of about 50%. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis that could
inspire future research in this field. We will release the code when the paper
is published.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We present a security proof for variable-length QKD in the Renner framework
against IID collective attacks. Our proof can be lifted to coherent attacks
using the postselection technique. Our first main result is a theorem to
convert a series of security proofs for fixed-length protocols satisfying
certain conditions to a security proof for a variable-length protocol. This
conversion requires no new calculations, does not require any changes to the
final key lengths or the amount of error-correction information, and at most
doubles the security parameter. Our second main result is the description and
security proof of a more general class of variable-length QKD protocols, which
does not require characterizing the honest behaviour of the channel connecting
the users before the execution of the QKD protocol. Instead, these protocols
adaptively determine the length of the final key, and the amount of information
to be used for error-correction, based upon the observations made during the
protocol. We apply these results to the qubit BB84 protocol, and show that
variable-length implementations lead to higher expected key rates than the
fixed-length implementations.

  This article develops a protocol to synchronize clocks on board a network of

common clock that is more stable and precise than its constituents. We envision
the resulting network as a master clock able to distribute time across the
globe, providing the basis for a future quantum global navigation satellite
system or a space-based quantum network. As an example of its capabilities, we
show that a constellation of 50 satellites equipped with modest quantum
resources, and distributed amongst 5 orbits at an altitude of 500 km, allows
the synchronization of clocks spread across the globe at sub-nanosecond
precision.

  We study how the successive scattering of spin 1/2 particles with a central
spin 1/2 target particle can generate entanglement between the helicity degrees
of freedom of all scattered particles, effectively producing a multipartite
entangled state. We show that the bipartite entanglement between each pair of
scattered particles, as quantified by the concurrence, is largest for reflected
particles and decreases with the number of scatterings. We study the
entanglement generation as a function of the scattered particles momenta,
angular distribution and mass ratios, and show that there is always a
combination of optimal helicities and momentum which generate the largest
amount of bipartite entanglement.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Security of modern classical data encryption often relies on computationally
hard problems, which can be trivialized with the advent of quantum computers. A
potential remedy for this is quantum communication which takes advantage of the
laws of quantum physics to provide secure exchange of information. Here,
quantum key distribution (QKD) represents a powerful tool, allowing for
unconditionally secure quantum communication between remote parties. At the
same time, microwave quantum communication is set to play an important role in
future quantum networks because of its natural frequency compatibility with
superconducting quantum processors and modern near-distance communication
standards. To this end, we present an experimental realization of a
continuous-variable QKD protocol based on propagating displaced squeezed
microwave states. We use superconducting parametric devices for generation and
single-shot quadrature detection of these states. We demonstrate unconditional
security in our experimental microwave QKD setting. We show that security
performance can be improved by adding finite trusted noise to the preparation
side. Our results indicate feasibility of secure microwave quantum
communication with the currently available technology in both open-air (up to
$\sim$ 80 m) and cryogenic (over 1000 m) conditions.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Fracton codes host unconventional topological states of matter and are
promising for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their large coding
space and strong resilience against decoherence and noise. In this work, we
investigate the ground-state properties and phase transitions of two
prototypical self-dual fracton spin models -- the tetrahedral Ising model and
the fractal Ising model -- which correspond to error-correction procedures for
the representative fracton codes of type-I and type-II, the checkerboard code
and the Haah's code, respectively, in the error-free limit. They are endowed
with exotic symmetry-breaking properties that contrast sharply with the
spontaneous breaking of global symmetries and deconfinement transition of gauge
theories. To show these unconventional behaviors, which are associated with
sub-dimensional symmetries, we construct and analyze the order parameters,
correlators, and symmetry generators for both models. Notably, the tetrahedral
Ising model acquires an extended semi-local ordering moment, while the fractal
Ising model fits into a polynomial ring representation and leads to a fractal
order parameter. Numerical studies combined with analytical tools show that
both models experience a strong first-order phase transition with an anomalous
$L^{-(D-1)}$ scaling, despite the fractal symmetry of the latter. Our work
provides new understanding of sub-dimensional symmetry breaking and makes an
important step for studying quantum-error-correction properties of the
checkerboard and Haah's codes.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We propose a scheme to squeeze mechanical motion and to entangle optical
field with mechanical motion in an optomechanical system containing a
parametric amplification. The scheme is based on optical bistability which
emerges in the system for a strong enough driving field. By considering the
steady state's lower branch of the bistability, the system shows weak
entanglement and almost no mechanical squeezing. When the steady state is on
the upper branch of the bistable shape, both squeezing and entanglement are
greatly enhanced. Specifically, the entanglement shows three degrees of
magnitude enhancement. However, this giant entanglement is fragile against
decoherence and thermal fluctuation. Regarding the mechanical squeezing, it
reaches the standard quantum limit (SQL) in the upper branch of the
bistability. Our proposal provides a way to improve quantum effects in
optomechanical systems by taking advantage of nonlinearities. This scheme can
be realized in similar systems such as superconducting microwave, and hybrid
optomechanical systems.

**Beyond i.i.d. in the Resource Theory of Asymmetry: An Information-Spectrum Approach for Quantum Fisher Information**—2022-04-18 (updated: 2023-11-18)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08439v6)]<br/>Koji Yamaguchi, Hiroyasu Tajima
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Energetic coherence is indispensable for various operations, including
precise measurement of time and acceleration of quantum manipulations. Since
energetic coherence is fragile, it is essential to understand the limits in
distillation and dilution to restore damage. The resource theory of asymmetry
(RTA) provides a rigorous framework to investigate energetic coherence as a
resource to break time-translation symmetry. Recently, in the i.i.d. regime
where identical copies of a state are converted into identical copies of
another state, it has been shown that the convertibility of energetic coherence
is governed by a standard measure of energetic coherence, called the quantum
Fisher information (QFI). This fact means that QFI in the theory of energetic
coherence takes the place of entropy in thermodynamics and entanglement entropy
in entanglement theory. However, distillation and dilution in realistic
situations take place in regimes beyond i.i.d., where quantum states often have
complex correlations. Unlike entanglement theory, the conversion theory of
energetic coherence in pure states in the non-i.i.d. regime has been an open
problem. In this Letter, we solve this problem by introducing a new technique:
an information-spectrum method for QFI. Two fundamental quantities, coherence
cost and distillable coherence, are shown to be equal to the spectral QFI rates
for arbitrary sequences of pure states. As a consequence, we find that both
entanglement theory and RTA in the non-i.i.d. regime are understood in the
information-spectrum method, while they are based on different quantities,
i.e., entropy and QFI, respectively.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Formalizations of quantum information theory in category theory and type
theory, for the design of verifiable quantum programming languages, need to
express its two fundamental characteristics: (1) parameterized linearity and
(2) metricity. The first is naturally addressed by dependent-linearly typed
languages such as Proto-Quipper or, following our recent observations: Linear
Homotopy Type Theory (LHoTT). The second point has received much attention
(only) in the form of semantics in "dagger-categories", where operator adjoints
are axiomatized but their specification to Hermitian adjoints still needs to be
imposed by hand.
  We describe a natural emergence of Hermiticity which is rooted in principles
of equivariant homotopy theory, lends itself to homotopically-typed languages
and naturally connects to topological quantum states classified by twisted
equivariant KR-theory. Namely, we observe that when the complex numbers are
considered as a monoid internal to Z/2-equivariant real linear types, via
complex conjugation, then (finite-dimensional) Hilbert spaces do become
self-dual objects among internally-complex Real modules.
  The point is that this construction of Hermitian forms requires of the
ambient linear type theory nothing further than a negative unit term of tensor
unit type. We observe that just such a term is constructible in LHoTT, where it
interprets as an element of the infinity-group of units of the sphere spectrum,
tying the foundations of quantum theory to homotopy theory. We close by
indicating how this allows for encoding (and verifying) the unitarity of
quantum gates and of quantum channels in quantum languages embedded into LHoTT.

relaxation time of transport particles. For comparison, we also define a
non-equilibrium temperature for the transport particle by its distribution
function out of equilibrium, which is different from the equilibrium
temperature of reservoir. There exist heat transfer between the transport
particle and the reservoir, because the whole transport particles are in
non-equilibrium state. Finally, we illustrate them by an example of
one-dimensional transport procedure, the damping force and the non-equilibrium
temperature defined by us are shown numerically.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  As shown by Abramsky and Coecke, quantum mechanics can be studied in terms of
dagger compact closed categories with biproducts. Within this structure, many
well-known quantum protocols can be described and their validity can be shown
by establishing the commutativity of certain diagrams in that category. In this
paper, we propose an explicit realisation of a category with enough structure
to check the validity of a certain class of quantum protocols. In order to do
this, we construct a category based on 1-dimensional cobordisms with attached
elements of a certain group freely generated by a finite set. We use this
category as a graphical language, and we show that it is dagger compact closed
with biproducts. Then, relying on the coherence result for compact closed
categories, proved by Kelly and Laplaza, we show the coherence result, which
enables us to check the validity of quantum protocols just by drawing diagrams.
In particular, we show the validity of quantum teleportation, entanglement
swapping (as formulated in the work of Abramsky and Coecke) and superdense
coding protocol.

**Collective effects enhanced multi-qubit information engines**—2023-06-21 (updated: 2023-11-18)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12072v2)]<br/>Noufal Jaseem, Victor Mukherjee
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We study a quantum information engine (QIE) modeled by a multi-qubit working
medium (WM) collectively coupled to a single thermal bath. We show that one can
harness the collective effects to significantly enhance the performance of the
QIE, as compared to equivalent engines lacking collective effects. We use one
bit of information about the WM magnetization to extract work from the thermal
bath. We analyze the work output, noise-to-signal ratio and thermodynamic
uncertainty relation, and contrast these performance metrics of a collective
QIE with that of an engine whose WM qubits are coupled independently to a
thermal bath. We show that in the limit of high temperatures of the thermal
bath, a collective QIE always outperforms its independent counterpart. In
contrast to quantum heat engines, where collective enhancement in specific heat
plays a direct role in improving the performance of the engines, here the
collective advantage stems from higher occupation probabilities for the higher
energy levels of the positive magnetization states, as compared to the
independent case.

**Negativity volume of the generalized Wigner function in gravitating hybrid system**—2023-11-18—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10980v1)]<br/>Daisuke Miki, Akira Matsumura, Kazuhiro Yamamoto
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We evaluate the gravity-induced negativity volume of the generalized Wigner
function in a hybrid system consisting of a particle in a two-localized
superposition state and an oscillator. The generalized Wigner function can
capture the nonclassicality of the system. The increase in the negativity
volume of the generalized Wigner function can be an indicator of the
entanglement generation, which is demonstrated in the hybrid system generating
the gravity-induced entanglement in various initial states. Moreover, by
comparing the behaviors of the negativity volume with the entanglement
fidelity, we show that the nonclassical feature of entanglement is properly
identified by the criterion based on the negativity volume of the generalized
Wigner function when the oscillator is initially in a thermal state.

**Ridiculously Compact Entanglement Purification**—2023-11-18—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10971v1)]<br/>Craig Gidney
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  This paper shows that entanglement can be purified using very little storage,
assuming the only source of noise is in the quantum channel being used to share
the entanglement. Entangled pairs with a target infidelity of $\epsilon$ can be
created in $\tilde{O}(\log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ time using $O(\log^{\ast}
\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ storage space, where $\log^{\ast}$ is the iterated
logarithm. This is achieved by using multiple stages of error detection, with
boosting within each stage. Concretely, the paper shows that 9 qubits of
noiseless storage is enough to turn entanglement with an infidelity of $1/3$
into way-better-than-anything-you'll-ever-need entanglement with an infidelity
of $10^{-78}$. Alternatively, for the truly discerning, 11 qubits is enough to
reach an infidelity of $10^{-1000000000000000000000000000}$.

**Security of quantum key distribution from generalised entropy accumulation**—2022-03-09 (updated: 2023-11-18)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04993v2)]<br/>Tony Metger, Renato Renner
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The goal of quantum key distribution (QKD) is to establish a secure key
between two parties connected by an insecure quantum channel. To use a QKD
protocol in practice, one has to prove that a finite size key is secure against
general attacks: no matter the adversary's attack, they cannot gain useful
information about the key. A much simpler task is to prove security against
collective attacks, where the adversary is assumed to behave identically and
independently in each round. In this work, we provide a formal framework for
general QKD protocols and show that for any protocol that can be expressed in
this framework, security against general attacks reduces to security against
collective attacks, which in turn reduces to a numerical computation. Our proof
relies on a recently developed information-theoretic tool called generalised
entropy accumulation and can handle generic prepare-and-measure protocols
directly without switching to an entanglement-based version.

Wang, Ruixia Wang, Peng Zhao, Z. H. Yang, Kaixuan Huang, Kai Xu, Yong-Sheng Zhang, Heng Fan, S. P. Zhao, Meng-Jun Hu, Haifeng Yu
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The concept of Maxwell demon plays an essential role in connecting
thermodynamics and information theory, while entanglement and non-locality are
fundamental features of quantum theory. Given the rapid advancements in the
field of quantum information science, there is a growing interest and
significance in investigating the connection between Maxwell demon and quantum
correlation. The majority of research endeavors thus far have been directed
towards the extraction of work from quantum correlation through the utilization
of Maxwell demon. Recently, a novel concept called Maxwell demon-assistant
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering has been proposed, which suggests that
it is possible to simulate quantum correlation by doing work. This seemingly
counterintuitive conclusion is attributed to the fact that Alice and Bob need
classical communication during EPR steering task, a requirement that does not
apply in the Bell test. In this study, we demonstrate Maxwell demon-assistant
EPR steering with superconducting quantum circuits. By compiling and optimizing
a quantum circuit to be implemented on a 2D superconducting chip, we were able
to achieve a steering parameter of $S_{2} = 0.770 \pm 0.005$ in the case of two
measurement settings, which surpasses the classical bound of $1/\sqrt{2}$ by
12.6 standard deviations. In addition, experimental observations have revealed
a linear correlation between the non-locality demonstrated in EPR steering and
the work done by the demon. Considering the errors in practical operation, the
experimental results are highly consistent with theoretical predictions. Our
findings not only suggest the presence of a Maxwell demon loophole in the EPR
steering, but also contribute to a deeper comprehension of the interplay
between quantum correlation, information theory, and thermodynamics.

**Comparison among Classical, Probabilistic and Quantum Algorithms for Hamiltonian Cycle problem**—2023-11-18—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10941v1)]<br/>Giuseppe Corrente, Carlo Vincenzo Stanzione, Vittoria Stanzione
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The Hamiltonian cycle problem (HCP), which is an NP-complete problem,
consists of having a graph G with n nodes and m edges and finding the path that
connects each node exactly once. In this paper we compare some algorithms to
solve a Hamiltonian cycle problem, using different models of computations and
especially the probabilistic and quantum ones. Starting from the classical
probabilistic approach of random walks, we take a step to the quantum direction
by involving an ad hoc designed Quantum Turing Machine (QTM), which can be a
useful conceptual project tool for quantum algorithms. Introducing several
constraints to the graphs, our analysis leads to not-exponential speedup
improvements to the best-known algorithms. In particular, the results are based
on bounded degree graphs (graphs with nodes having a maximum number of edges)
and graphs with the right limited number of nodes and edges to allow them to
outperform the other algorithms.

  The canonical group quantization approach has been used to study
noncommutative graphene in the presence of dual magnetic fields. The canonical
group for the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2\times \mathbb{R}^2$ with both symmetric
and Landau dual gauges is shown to be equivalent to $\mathtt{H}^2\rtimes
\mathbb{R}$. The representations of both symmetric and Landau dual gauges lead
to similar canonical commutation relations, and we observe that the energy
spectrum is corrected by both dual magnetic fields, yielding the same result.

**Extreme quantum states and processes, and extreme points of general spectrahedra in finite dimensional algebras**—2023-11-18—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10929v1)]<br/>Giulio Chiribella
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Convex sets of quantum states and processes play a central role in quantum
theory and quantum information. Many important examples of convex sets in
quantum theory are spectrahedra, that is, sets of positive operators subject to
affine constraints. These examples include sets of quantum states with given
expectation values of some observables of interest, sets of multipartite
quantum states with given marginals, sets of quantum measurements, channels,
and multitime quantum processes, as well as sets of higher-order quantum maps
and quantum causal structures. This contribution provides a characterisation of
the extreme points of general spectrahedra, and bounds on the ranks of the
corresponding operators. The general results are applied to several special
cases, and are used to retrieve classic results such as Choi's characterisation
of the extreme quantum channels, Parhasarathy's characterisation of the extreme
quantum states with given marginals, and the quantum version of Birkhoff's
theorem for qubit unital channels. Finally, we propose a notion of positive
operator valued measures (POVMs) with general affine constraints for their
normalisation, and we characterise the extremal POVMs.

**Semiclassical Theory and the Koopman-van Hove Equation**—2023-06-02 (updated: 2023-11-18)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01865v2)]<br/>Ilon Joseph
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The phase space Koopman-van Hove (KvH) equation can be derived from the
asymptotic semiclassical analysis of partial differential equations.
Semiclassical theory yields the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the complex phase
factor and the transport equation for the amplitude. These two equations can be
combined to form a nonlinear semiclassical version of the KvH equation in
configuration space. There is a natural injection of configuration space
solutions into phase space and a natural projection of phase space solutions
onto configuration space. Hence, every solution of the configuration space KvH
equation satisfies both the semiclassical phase space KvH equation and the
Hamilton-Jacobi constraint. For configuration space solutions, this constraint
resolves the paradox that there are two different conserved densities in phase
space. For integrable systems, the KvH spectrum is the Cartesian product of a
classical and a semiclassical spectrum. If the classical spectrum is
eliminated, then, with the correct choice of Jeffreys-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin
(JWKB) matching conditions, the semiclassical spectrum satisfies the
Einstein-Brillouin-Keller quantization conditions which include the correction
due to the Maslov index. However, semiclassical analysis uses different choices
for boundary conditions, continuity requirements, and the domain of definition.
For example, use of the complex JWKB method allows for the treatment of
tunneling through the complexification of phase space. Finally, although KvH
wavefunctions include the possibility of interference effects, interference is
not observable when all observables are approximated as local operators on
phase space. Observing interference effects requires consideration of nonlocal
operations, e.g. through higher orders in the asymptotic theory.

**Control of the Purcell effect via unexcited atoms and exceptional points**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10884v1)]<br/>G. S. Agarwal
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We examine the possible control of the celebrated Purcell effect in cavity
quantum electrodynamics. We demonstrate that the presence of an unexcited atom
can significantly alter the Purcell decay depending on the strength of coupling
of the unexcited atom with the cavity mode though the excited atom has to be
weakly coupled for it to be in the Purcell regime. This is distinct from the
nonradiative nature of the singlet state which is an entangled state of the two
atom system. We present physical interpretation for inhibition as due to
interference between two polariton channels of decay. We bring out connection
to exceptional points in the cavity QED system as the unexcited atom and cavity
mode can produce a second order exceptional point. We further show how two
unexcited atoms can create a third order exceptional point leading to
inhibition of Purcell effect. We also discuss the case when the Purcell effect
can be enhanced.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We introduce a prototypical model for cavity polaritonic control of ultracold
photochemistry by considering the resonant vibrational strong coupling of a
rubidium dimer to a terahertz cavity. We demonstrate that at avoided crossings
between a vibrational excitation and the vacuum photon absorption, the
resulting polaritonic states between the molecule and photons can efficiently
control the molecular vibrational Franck-Condon (FC) factors. Due to the
entanglement between light and matter, FC factor is transferred from one
polaritonic branch to other, leading to a polariton with a substantially
enhanced FC factor. Utilizing this polariton state for photoassociation results
in the enhanced formation of ultracold molecules. This work suggests a path to
controlling photoassociation with cavity vacuum fields, and lays the ground for
the emerging subfield of polaritonic ultracold chemistry.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Recent developments in domains such as non-local games, quantum interactive
proofs, and quantum generative adversarial networks have renewed interest in
quantum game theory and, specifically, quantum zero-sum games. Central to
classical game theory is the efficient algorithmic computation of Nash
equilibria, which represent optimal strategies for both players. In 2008, Jain
and Watrous proposed the first classical algorithm for computing equilibria in
quantum zero-sum games using the Matrix Multiplicative Weight Updates (MMWU)
method to achieve a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon^2)$ iterations
to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in the $4^d$-dimensional spectraplex. In this
work, we propose a hierarchy of quantum optimization algorithms that generalize
MMWU via an extra-gradient mechanism. Notably, within this proposed hierarchy,
we introduce the Optimistic Matrix Multiplicative Weights Update (OMMWU)
algorithm and establish its average-iterate convergence complexity as
$\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria. This
quadratic speed-up relative to Jain and Watrous' original algorithm sets a new
benchmark for computing $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in quantum zero-sum games.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We simulated modifications to a model of a two-dimensional paramagnetic
semiconductor called the half-BHZ model, also known as the QWZ model, and
simulated a modified full BHZ model, where a time reversal pair is introduced.
Our modifications to the models include adding single and multiple impurities
connected to the lattices or as a connection between the time-reversal pairs.
We employed the Julia programming language to show how to speed up calculations
for time evolutions. By simulating the time evolutions, we could observe the
differences in the effects of these modifications. Our simulations showed the
presence of scattering behavior associated with the infinite QWZ model
topological states. Moreover, we observed scattering and absorption behavior
related to the parameters and placements of impurities and Hamiltonian
imaginary component's symmetry or anti-symmetry. These tools and early results
lay the foundations for developing electronic devices that use the models'
unique scattering and absorption behaviors and explore more complex and
physically accurate modifications to the models.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We develop quantum information processing primitives for the planar rotor,
the state space of a particle on a circle. By interpreting rotor wavefunctions
as periodically identified wavefunctions of a harmonic oscillator, we determine
the group of bosonic Gaussian operations inherited by the rotor. This $n$-rotor
Clifford group, $\text{U}(1)^{n(n+1)/2} \rtimes \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, is
represented by continuous $\text{U}(1)$ gates generated by polynomials
quadratic in angular momenta, as well as discrete $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb Z)$
momentum sign-flip and sum gates. We classify homological rotor
error-correcting codes [arXiv:2303.13723] and various rotor states based on
equivalence under Clifford operations.
  Reversing direction, we map homological rotor codes and rotor Clifford
operations back into oscillators by interpreting occupation-number states as
rotor states of non-negative angular momentum. This yields new multimode
homological bosonic codes protecting against dephasing and changes in
occupation number, along with their corresponding encoding and decoding
circuits. In particular, we show how to non-destructively measure the
oscillator phase using conditional occupation-number addition and post
selection. We also outline several rotor and oscillator varieties of the
GKP-stabilizer codes [arXiv:1903.12615].

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We introduce a Hilbert space based resource theory of Bell nonlocality with
the aim of providing bona fide measures of quantum nonlocality depending only
on the intrinsic properties of the quantum states being considered. We
construct our theory by defining the set of local (or free) states, i.e., the
states that do not violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality; the set
of free operations, i.e., the transformations that do not create the
nonlocality resource, which includes local operations and shared randomness;
and suitable measures of nonlocality based either on geometric distances or
relative entropies with respect to the set of local states. We discuss the
basic axiomatic structure that is needed for a meaningful characterization and
quantification of Bell nonlocality and we illustrate the general resource
theory so developed by applying it to specific classes of quantum states,
including two-qubit Werner states, Bell-diagonal states, and Bell-diagonal
states at fixed convexity.

**Breakdown of steady-state superradiance in extended driven atomic arrays**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10824v1)]<br/>Stefan Ostermann, Oriol Rubies-Bigorda, Victoria Zhang, Susanne F. Yelin
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Recent advances in generating well controlled dense arrangements of
individual atoms in free space have generated interest in understanding how the
extended nature of these systems influences superradiance phenomena. Here, we
provide an in-depth analysis on how space-dependent light-shifts and decay
rates induced by dipole-dipole interactions modify the steady-state properties
of coherently driven arrays of quantum emitters. We characterize the
steady-state phase diagram, with particular focus on the radiative properties
in the steady-state. Interestingly, we find that diverging from the
well-established Dicke paradigm of equal all-to-all interactions significantly
modifies the emission properties. In particular, the prominent quadratic
scaling of the radiated light intensity with particle number in the steady
state - a hallmark of steady-state Dicke superradiance - is entirely
suppressed, resulting in only linear scaling with particle number. We show that
this breakdown of steady-state superradiance occurs due to the emergence of
additional dissipation channels that populate not only superradiant states but
also subradiant ones. The additional contribution of subradiant dark states in
the dynamics leads to a divergence in the time scales needed to achieve steady
states. Building on this, we further show that measurements taken at finite
times for extended atom ensembles reveal properties closely mirroring the
idealized Dicke scenario.

**Gradients and frequency profiles of quantum re-uploading models**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10822v1)]<br/>Alice Barthe, Adrián Pérez-Salinas
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum re-uploading models have been extensively investigated as a form of
machine learning within the context of variational quantum algorithms. Their
trainability and expressivity are not yet fully understood and are critical to
their performance. In this work, we address trainability through the lens of
the magnitude of the gradients of the cost function. We prove bounds for the
differences between gradients of the better-studied data-less parameterized
quantum circuits and re-uploading models. We coin the concept of {\sl
absorption witness} to quantify such difference. For the expressivity, we prove
that quantum re-uploading models output functions with vanishing high-frequency
components and upper-bounded derivatives with respect to data. As a
consequence, such functions present limited sensitivity to fine details, which
protects against overfitting. We performed numerical experiments extending the
theoretical results to more relaxed and realistic conditions. Overall, future
designs of quantum re-uploading models will benefit from the strengthened
knowledge delivered by the uncovering of absorption witnesses and vanishing
high frequencies.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We study the average and the standard deviation of the entanglement entropy
of highly excited eigenstates of the integrable interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
XYZ chain away from and at special lines with $U(1)$ symmetry and
supersymmetry. We universally find that the average eigenstate entanglement
entropy exhibits a volume-law coefficient that is smaller than that of
quantum-chaotic interacting models. At the supersymmetric point, we resolve the
effect that degeneracies have on the computed averages. We further find that
the normalized standard deviation of the eigenstate entanglement entropy decays
polynomially with increasing system size, which we contrast to the exponential
decay in quantum-chaotic interacting models. Our results provide state-of-the
art numerical evidence that integrability in spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains reduces
the average, and increases the standard deviation, of the entanglement entropy
of highly excited energy eigenstates when compared to those in quantum-chaotic
interacting models.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Despite the widespread use and success of machine-learning techniques for
detecting phase transitions from data, their working principle and fundamental
limits remain elusive. Here, we explain the inner workings and identify
potential failure modes of these techniques by rooting popular machine-learning
indicators of phase transitions in information-theoretic concepts. Using tools
from information geometry, we prove that several machine-learning indicators of
phase transitions approximate the square root of the system's (quantum) Fisher
information from below -- a quantity that is known to indicate phase
transitions but is often difficult to compute from data. We numerically
demonstrate the quality of these bounds for phase transitions in classical and
quantum systems.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We introduce the Trapped-Ion Surface Code Compiler (TISCC), a software tool
that generates circuits for a universal set of surface code patch operations in
terms of a native trapped-ion gate set. To accomplish this, TISCC manages an
internal representation of a trapped-ion system where a repeating pattern of
trapping zones and junctions is arranged in an arbitrarily large rectangular
grid. Surface code operations are compiled by instantiating surface code
patches on the grid and using methods to generate transversal operations over
data qubits, rounds of error correction over stabilizer plaquettes, and/or
lattice surgery operations between neighboring patches. Beyond the
implementation of a basic surface code instruction set, TISCC contains corner
movement functionality and a patch translation that is implemented using ion
movement alone. Except in the latter case, all TISCC functionality is
extensible to alternative grid-like hardware architectures. TISCC output has
been verified using the Oak Ridge Quasi-Clifford Simulator (ORQCS).

**Realistic Cost to Execute Practical Quantum Circuits using Direct Clifford+T Lattice Surgery Compilation**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10686v1)]<br/>Tyler LeBlond, Christopher Dean, George Watkins, Ryan S. Bennink
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this article, we report the development of a resource estimation pipeline
that explicitly compiles quantum circuits expressed using the Clifford+T gate
set into a lower level instruction set made out of fault-tolerant operations on
the surface code. The cadence of magic state requests from the compiled circuit
enables the optimization of magic state distillation and storage requirements
in a post-hoc analysis. To compile logical circuits, we build upon the
open-source Lattice Surgery Compiler, which is extensible to different surface
code compilation strategies within the lattice surgery paradigm. The revised
compiler operates in two stages: the first translates logical gates into an
abstract, layout-independent instruction set; the second compiles these into
local lattice surgery instructions that are allocated to hardware tiles
according to a specified resource layout. In the second stage, parallelism in
the logical circuit is translated into parallelism within the fault-tolerant
layer while avoiding resource contention, which allows the compiler to find a
realistic number of logical time-steps to execute the circuit. The revised
compiler also improves the handling of magic states by allowing users to
specify dedicated hardware tiles at which magic states are replenished
according to a user-specified rate, which allows resource costs from the
logical computation to be considered independently from magic state
distillation and storage. We demonstrate the applicability of our resource
estimation pipeline to large, practical quantum circuits by providing resource
estimates for the ground state estimation of molecules. We find that, unless
carefully considered, the resource costs of magic state storage can dominate in
real circuits which have variable magic state consumption rates.

  We prove a tight parallel repetition theorem for $3$-message
computationally-secure quantum interactive protocols between an efficient
challenger and an efficient adversary. We also prove under plausible
assumptions that the security of $4$-message computationally secure protocols
does not generally decrease under parallel repetition. These mirror the
classical results of Bellare, Impagliazzo, and Naor [BIN97]. Finally, we prove
that all quantum argument systems can be generically compiled to an equivalent
$3$-message argument system, mirroring the transformation for quantum proof
systems [KW00, KKMV07].
  As immediate applications, we show how to derive hardness amplification
theorems for quantum bit commitment schemes (answering a question of Yan

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We develop closed-form expressions for the moments and cumulants of Gaussian
states when measured in the photon-number basis. We express the photon-number
moments of a Gaussian state in terms of the loop Hafnian, a function that when
applied to a $(0,1)$-matrix representing the adjacency of a graph, counts the
number of its perfect matchings. Similarly, we express the photon-number
cumulants in terms of the Montrealer, a newly introduced matrix function that
when applied to a $(0,1)$-matrix counts the number of Hamiltonian cycles of
that graph. Based on these graph-theoretic connections, we show that the
calculation of photon-number moments and cumulants are $#P$-hard. Moreover, we
provide an exponential time algorithm to calculate Montrealers (and thus
cumulants), matching well-known results for Hafnians. We then demonstrate that
when a uniformly lossy interferometer is fed in every input with identical
single-mode Gaussian states with zero displacement, all the odd-order cumulants
but the first one are zero. Finally, we employ the expressions we derive to
study the distribution of cumulants up to the fourth order for different input
states in a Gaussian boson sampling setup where $K$ identical states are fed
into an $\ell$-mode interferometer. We analyze the dependence of the cumulants
as a function of the type of input state, squeezed, lossy squeezed, squashed,
or thermal, and as a function of the number of non-vacuum inputs. We find that
thermal states perform much worse than other classical states, such as squashed
states, at mimicking the photon-number cumulants of lossy or lossless squeezed
states.

**A Proof of Specker's Principle**—2023-05-13 (updated: 2023-11-17)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07917v2)]<br/>Guido Bacciagaluppi
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Specker's principle, the condition that pairwise orthogonal propositions must
be jointly orthogonal, has been much investigated recently within the programme
of finding physical principles to characterise quantum mechanics. It largely
appears, however, to lack a transparent justification. In this paper, I provide
a derivation of Specker's principle from three assumptions (made suitably
precise): the existence of maximal entanglement, the existence of non-maximal
measurements, and no-signalling. I discuss these three assumptions and describe
canonical examples of non-Specker sets of propositions satisfying any two of
them. These examples display analogies with various approaches in the
interpretation of quantum mechanics, notably ones based on retrocausation. I
also discuss connections with the work of Popescu and Rohrlich. The core of the
proof (and the main example violating no-signalling) is illustrated by a
variant of Specker's tale of the seer of Nineveh, with which I open the paper.

**On the Pauli Spectrum of QAC0**—2023-11-16 (updated: 2023-11-17)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09631v2)]<br/>Shivam Nadimpalli, Natalie Parham, Francisca Vasconcelos, Henry Yuen
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The circuit class $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ was introduced by Moore (1999) as a model
for constant depth quantum circuits where the gate set includes many-qubit
Toffoli gates. Proving lower bounds against such circuits is a longstanding
challenge in quantum circuit complexity; in particular, showing that
polynomial-size $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ cannot compute the parity function has
remained an open question for over 20 years.
  In this work, we identify a notion of the Pauli spectrum of $\mathsf{QAC}^0$
circuits, which can be viewed as the quantum analogue of the Fourier spectrum
of classical $\mathsf{AC}^0$ circuits. We conjecture that the Pauli spectrum of
$\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits satisfies low-degree concentration, in analogy to the
famous Linial, Nisan, Mansour theorem on the low-degree Fourier concentration
of $\mathsf{AC}^0$ circuits. If true, this conjecture immediately implies that
polynomial-size $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits cannot compute parity.
  We prove this conjecture for the class of depth-$d$, polynomial-size
$\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits with at most $n^{O(1/d)}$ auxiliary qubits. We obtain
new circuit lower bounds and learning results as applications: this class of
circuits cannot correctly compute
  - the $n$-bit parity function on more than $(\frac{1}{2} +
2^{-\Omega(n^{1/d})})$-fraction of inputs, and
  - the $n$-bit majority function on more than $(1 -
1/\mathrm{poly}(n))$-fraction of inputs.
  Additionally we show that this class of $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits with
limited auxiliary qubits can be learned with quasipolynomial sample complexity,
giving the first learning result for $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits.
  More broadly, our results add evidence that "Pauli-analytic" techniques can
be a powerful tool in studying quantum circuits.

**Non-Zero Mean Quantum Wishart Distribution Of Random Quantum States**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10672v1)]<br/>Shrobona Bagchi
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Random quantum states are useful in various areas of quantum information
science. Distributions of random quantum states using Gaussian distributions
have been used in various scenarios in quantum information science. One of this
is the distribution of random quantum states derived using the Wishart
distibution usually used in statistics. This distribution of random quantum
states using the Wishart distribution has recently been named as the quantum
Wishart distribution. The quantum Wishart distribution has been found for
non-central distribution with a general covariance matrix and zero mean matrix
in an earlier work. Here, we find out the closed form expression for the
distribution of random quantum states pertaining to non-central Wishart
distribution with any general rank one mean matrix and a general covariance
matrix for arbitrary dimensions in both real and complex Hilbert space. We term
this as the non-zero mean quantum Wishart distribution.

Maciejewski, Joanna Majsak, Oskar Słowik, Marcin Kotowski, Katarzyna Kowalczyk-Murynka, Piotr Podziemski, Michał\ Oszmaniec
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Readout errors contribute significantly to the overall noise affecting
present-day quantum computers. However, the complete characterization of
generic readout noise is infeasible for devices consisting of a large number of
qubits. Here we introduce an appropriately tailored quantum detector tomography
protocol, the so called Quantum Detector Overlapping Tomography, which enables
efficient characterization of $k-$local cross-talk effects in the readout noise
as the sample complexity of the protocol scales logarithmically with the total
number of qubits. We show that QDOT data provides information about suitably
defined reduced POVM operators, correlations and coherences in the readout
noise, as well as allows to reconstruct the correlated clusters and neighbours
readout noise model. Benchmarks are introduced to verify utility and accuracy
of the reconstructed model. We apply our method to investigate cross-talk
effects on 79 qubit Rigetti and 127 qubit IBM devices. We discuss their readout
noise characteristics, and demonstrate effectiveness of our approach by showing
superior performance of correlated clusters and neighbours over models without
cross-talk in model-based readout error mitigation applied to energy estimation
of MAX-2-SAT Hamiltonians, with the improvement on the order of 20% for both
devices.

**Markovian master equations for quantum-classical hybrid systems**—2023-10-03 (updated: 2023-11-17)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02006v2)]<br/>Alberto Barchielli
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The problem of constructing a consistent quantum-classical hybrid dynamics is
afforded in the case of a quantum component in a separable Hilbert space and a
continuous, finite-dimensional classical component. In the Markovian case, the
problem is formalized by the notion of hybrid dynamical semigroup. A classical
component can be observed without perturbing the system and information on the
quantum component can be extracted, thanks to the quantum-classical
interaction. This point is formalized by showing how to introduce positive
operator valued measures and operations compatible with the hybrid dynamical
semigroup; in this way the notion of hybrid dynamics is connected to quantum
measurements in continuous time. Then, the case of the most general quasi-free
generator is presented and the various quantum-classical interaction terms are
discussed. To bee quasi-free means to send, in the Heisenberg description,
hybrid Weyl operators into multiples of Weyl operators; the results on the
structure of quasi-free semigroups were proved in the article arXiv:2307.02611.
Even in the pure quantum case, a quasi-free semigroup is not restricted to have
only a Gaussian structure, but also jump-type terms are allowed. An important
result is that, to have interactions producing a flow of information from the
quantum component to the classical one, suitable dissipative terms must be
present in the generator. Finally, some possibilities are discussed to go
beyond the quasi-free case.

  We present a general method to realize resonant coupling between spins even
though their energies are of different scales. Applying the method to the
electron and nuclear spin systems such as a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center with
its nearby nuclei, we show that a specific dynamical switching of the electron
spin Rabi frequency achieves efficient electron-nuclear coupling, providing a
much stronger quantum sensing signal and dynamic nuclear polarization than
previous methods. This protocol has applications in high-field nanoscale
nuclear magnetic resonances as well as low-power quantum control of nuclear
spins.

**Computable and Faithful Lower Bound for Entanglement Cost**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10649v1)]<br/>Xin Wang, Mingrui Jing, Chengkai Zhu
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum information processing.
However, quantifying the entanglement required to prepare quantum states and
implement quantum processes remains challenging. This paper proposes computable
and faithful lower bounds for the entanglement cost of general quantum states
and quantum channels. We introduce the concept of logarithmic $k$-negativity, a
generalization of logarithmic negativity, to establish a general lower bound
for the entanglement cost of quantum states under quantum operations that
completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose (PPT). This bound is
efficiently computable via semidefinite programming and is non-zero for any
entangled state that is not PPT, making it faithful in the entanglement theory
with non-positive partial transpose. Furthermore, we delve into specific and
general examples to demonstrate the advantages of our proposed bounds compared
with previously known computable ones. Notably, we affirm the irreversibility
of asymptotic entanglement manipulation under PPT operations for full-rank
entangled states and the irreversibility of channel manipulation for amplitude
damping channels. We also establish the best-known lower bound for the
entanglement cost of arbitrary dimensional isotropic states. These findings
push the boundaries of understanding the structure of entanglement and the
fundamental limits of entanglement manipulation.

**Spin squeezing in internal bosonic Josephson junctions via enhanced shortcuts to adiabaticity**—2023-05-31 (updated: 2023-11-17)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20032v3)]<br/>Manuel Odelli, Vladimir M. Stojanovic, Andreas Ruschhaupt
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We investigate a time-efficient and robust preparation of spin-squeezed
states -- a class of states of interest for quantum-enhanced metrology -- in
internal bosonic Josephson junctions with a time-dependent nonlinear coupling
strength between atoms in two different hyperfine states. We treat this
state-preparation problem, which had previously been addressed using shortcuts
to adiabaticity (STA), using the recently proposed analytical modification of
this class of quantum-control protocols that became known as the enhanced STA
(eSTA) method. We characterize the state-preparation process by evaluating the
time dependence of the coherent spin-squeezing and number-squeezing parameters
and the target-state fidelity. We show that the state-preparation times
obtained using the eSTA method compare favourably to those found in previously
proposed approaches. We also demonstrate that the increased robustness of the
eSTA approach -- compared to its STA counterpart -- leads to additional
advantages for potential experimental realizations of strongly spin-squeezed
states in bosonic Josephson junctions.

**QKD Entity Source Authentication: Defense-in-Depth for Post Quantum Cryptography**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10636v1)]<br/>John J. Prisco
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum key distribution (QKD) was conceived by Charles Bennett and Gilles
Brassard in December of 1984. In the ensuing 39 years QKD systems have been
deployed around the world to provide secure encryption for terrestrial as well
as satellite communication. In 2016 the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) began a program to standardize a series of quantum resistant
algorithms to replace our current encryption standards thereby protecting
against future quantum computers breaking public key cryptography. This program
is known as post quantum cryptography or PQC. One of the tenets of
cybersecurity is to use an approach that simultaneously provides multiple
protections known as defense-in-depth. This approach seeks to avoid single
points of failure. The goal of this paper is to examine the suitability of a
hybrid QKD / PQC defense-in-depth strategy. A focus of the paper will be to
examine the sufficiency of initial QKD hardware authentication (entity source
authentication) which is necessary to guard against man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Shadow tomography from emergent state designs in analog quantum simulators**—2022-12-05 (updated: 2023-11-17)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02543v2)]<br/>Max McGinley, Michele Fava
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We introduce a method that allows one to infer many properties of a quantum
state -- including nonlinear functions such as R\'enyi entropies -- using only
global control over the constituent degrees of freedom. In this protocol, the
state of interest is first entangled with a set of ancillas under a fixed
global unitary, before projective measurements are made. We show that when the
unitary is sufficiently entangling, a universal relationship between the
statistics of the measurement outcomes and properties of the state emerges,
which can be connected to the recently discovered phenomenon of emergent
quantum state designs in chaotic systems. Thanks to this relationship,
arbitrary observables can be reconstructed using the same number of
experimental repetitions that would be required in classical shadow tomography
[Huang et al., Nat. Phys. 16, 1050 (2020)]. Unlike previous approaches to
shadow tomography, our protocol can be implemented using only global
operations, as opposed to qubit-selective logic gates, which makes it
particularly well-suited to analog quantum simulators, including ultracold
atoms in optical lattices and arrays of Rydberg atoms.

**Quantum phases of hardcore bosons with repulsive dipolar density-density interactions on two-dimensional lattices**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10632v1)]<br/>J. A. Koziol, G. Morigi, K. P. Schmidt
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We analyse the ground-state quantum phase diagram of hardcore Bosons
interacting with repulsive dipolar potentials. The bosons dynamics is described
by the extended-Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a two-dimensional lattice. The
ground state results from the interplay between the lattice geometry and the
long-range interactions, which we account for by means of a classical spin
mean-field approach limited by the size of the considered unit cells. This
extended classical spin mean-field theory accounts for the long-range
density-density interaction without truncation. We consider three different
lattice geometries: square, honeycomb, and triangular. In the limit of zero
hopping the ground state is always a devil's staircase of solid (gapped)
phases. Such crystalline phases with broken translational symmetry are robust
with respect to finite hopping amplitudes. At intermediate hopping amplitudes,
these gapped phases melt, giving rise to various lattice supersolid phases,
which can have exotic features with multiple sublattice densities. At
sufficiently large hoppings the ground state is a superfluid. The stability of
phases predicted by our approach is gauged by comparison to the known quantum
phase diagrams of the Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbour interactions as
well as quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the dipolar case on the square
lattice. Our results are of immediate relevance for experimental realisations
of self-organised crystalline ordering patterns in analogue quantum simulators,
e.g., with ultracold dipolar atoms in an optical lattice.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The survival probability of an initial Coherent Gibbs State (CGS) is a
natural extension of the Spectral Form Factor (SFF) to open quantum systems. To
quantify the interplay between quantum chaos and decoherence away from the
semi-classical limit, we investigate the relation of this generalized SFF with
the corresponding $l_1$-norm of coherence. As a working example, we introduce
Parametric Quantum Channels (PQC), a discrete-time model of unitary evolution
periodically interrupted by the effects of measurements or transient
interactions with an environment. The Energy Dephasing (ED) dynamics arises as
a specific case in the Markovian limit. We demonstrate our results in a series
of random matrix models.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We study the quantum fluctuation theorem in the one-time measurement (OTM)
scheme, where the work distribution of the backward process has been lacking
and which is considered to be more informative than the two-time measurement
(TTM) scheme. We find that the OTM scheme is the quantum nondemolition TTM
scheme, in which the final state is a pointer state of the second measurement
whose Hamiltonian is conditioned on the first measurement outcome. Then, by
clarifying the backward work distribution in the OTM scheme, we derive the
detailed fluctuation theorem in the OTM scheme for the characteristic functions
of the forward and backward work distributions, which captures the detailed
information about the irreversibility and can be applied to quantum
thermometry. We also verified our conceptual findings with the IBM quantum
computer. Our result clarifies that the laws of thermodynamics at the nanoscale
are dependent on the choice of the measurement and may provide experimentalists
with a concrete strategy to explore laws of thermodynamics at the nanoscale by
protecting quantum coherence and correlations.

**Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Constraints (VQEC): Solving Constrained Optimization Problems via VQE**—2023-11-14 (updated: 2023-11-17)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08502v2)]<br/>Thinh Viet Le, Vassilis Kekatos
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Variational quantum approaches have shown great promise in finding
near-optimal solutions to computationally challenging tasks. Nonetheless,
enforcing constraints in a disciplined fashion has been largely unexplored. To
address this gap, this work proposes a hybrid quantum-classical algorithmic
paradigm termed VQEC that extends the celebrated VQE to handle optimization
with constraints. As with the standard VQE, the vector of optimization
variables is captured by the state of a variational quantum circuit (VQC). To
deal with constraints, VQEC optimizes a Lagrangian function classically over
both the VQC parameters as well as the dual variables associated with
constraints. To comply with the quantum setup, variables are updated via a
perturbed primal-dual method leveraging the parameter shift rule. Among a wide
gamut of potential applications, we showcase how VQEC can approximately solve
quadratically-constrained binary optimization (QCBO) problems, find stochastic
binary policies satisfying quadratic constraints on the average and in
probability, and solve large-scale linear programs (LP) over the probability
simplex. Under an assumption on the error for the VQC to approximate an
arbitrary probability mass function (PMF), we provide bounds on the optimality
gap attained by a VQC. Numerical tests on a quantum simulator investigate the
effect of various parameters and corroborate that VQEC can generate
high-quality solutions.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum computers are inherently affected by noise. While in the long-term
error correction codes will account for noise at the cost of increasing
physical qubits, in the near-term the performance of any quantum algorithm
should be tested and simulated in the presence of noise. As noise acts on the
hardware, the classical simulation of a quantum algorithm should not be
agnostic on the platform used for the computation. In this work, we apply the
recently proposed noisy gates approach to efficiently simulate noisy optical
circuits described in the dual rail framework. The evolution of the state
vector is simulated directly, without requiring the mapping to the density
matrix framework. Notably, we test the method on both the gate-based and
measurement-based quantum computing models, showing that the approach is very
versatile. We also evaluate the performance of a photonic variational quantum
algorithm to solve the MAX-2-CUT problem. In particular we design and simulate
an ansatz which is resilient to photon losses up to $p \sim 10^{-3}$ making it
relevant for near term applications.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We propose a protocol to realize quantum simulation and computation in spin
systems with long-range interactions. Our approach relies on the local
addressing of single spins with external fields parametrized by Walsh
functions. This enables a mapping from a class of target Hamiltonians, defined
by the graph structure of their interactions, to pulse sequences. We then
obtain a recipe to implement arbitrary two-body Hamiltonians and universal
quantum circuits. Performance guarantees are provided in terms of bounds on
Trotter errors and total number of pulses, and robustness to experimental
imperfections. We demonstrate and numerically benchmark our protocol with
examples from the dynamical of spin models, quantum error correction and
quantum optimization algorithms.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The efficient management of energy communities relies on the solution of the
"prosumer problem", i.e., the problem of scheduling the household loads on the
basis of the user needs, the electricity prices, and the availability of local
renewable energy, with the aim of reducing costs and energy waste. Quantum
computers can offer a significant breakthrough in treating this problem thanks
to the intrinsic parallel nature of quantum operations. The most promising
approach is to devise variational hybrid algorithms, in which quantum
computation is driven by parameters that are optimized classically, in a cycle
that aims at finding the best solution with a significant speed-up with respect
to classical approaches. This paper provides a reformulation of the prosumer
problem, allowing to address it with a hybrid quantum algorithm, namely,
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and with a recent variant,
the Recursive QAOA. We report on an extensive set of experiments, on simulators
and real quantum hardware, for different problem sizes. Results are encouraging
in that Recursive QAOA is able, for problems involving up to 10 qubits, to
provide optimal and admissible solutions with good probabilities, while the
computation time is nearly independent of the system size

resolved covariance mapping of the fragment ions highlights the nuclear motion,

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Qubits with predominantly erasure errors present distinctive advantages for
quantum error correction(QEC) and fault tolerant quantum computing. Logical
qubits based on dual-rail encoding that exploit erasure detection have been
recently proposed in superconducting circuit architectures, either with coupled
transmons or cavities. Here, we implement a dual-rail qubit encoded in a
compact, double-post superconducting cavity. Using an auxiliary transmon, we
perform erasure detection on the dual-rail subspace. We characterize the
behaviour of the codespace by a novel method to perform joint-Wigner
tomography. This is based on modifying the cross-Kerr interaction between the
cavity modes and the transmon. We measure an erasure rate of 3.981 +/- 0.003
(ms)-1 and a residual dephasing error rate up to 0.17 (ms)-1 within the
codespace. This strong hierarchy of error rates, together with the compact and
hardware-efficient nature of this novel architecture, hold promise in realising
QEC schemes with enhanced thresholds and improved scaling.

**Atomic Defect-Aware Physical Design of Silicon Dangling Bond Logic on the H-Si(100)2x1 Surface**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12042v1)]<br/>Marcel Walter, Jeremiah Croshaw, Samuel Sze Hang Ng, Konrad Walus, Robert Wolkow, Robert Wille
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Although fabrication capabilities of Silicon Dangling Bonds have rapidly
advanced from manual labor-driven laboratory work to automated manufacturing in
just recent years, sub-nanometer substrate defects still pose a hindrance to
production due to the need for atomic precision. In essence, unpassivated or
missing surface atoms, contaminants, and structural deformations disturb the
fabricated logic or prevent its realization altogether. Moreover, design
automation techniques in this domain have not yet adopted any defect-aware
behavior to circumvent the present obstacles. In this paper, we derive a
surface defect model for design automation from experimentally verified defect
types that we apply to identify sensitivities in an established gate library in
an effort to generate more robust designs. Furthermore, we present an automatic
placement and routing algorithm that considers scanning tunneling microscope
data obtained from physical experiments to lay out dot-accurate circuitry that
is resilient against the presence of atomic surface defects. This culminates in
a holistic evaluation on surface data of varying defect rates that enables us
to quantify the severity of such defects. We project that fabrication
capabilities must achieve defect rates of around 0.1 %, if charged defects can
be completely eliminated, or < 0.1 %, otherwise. This realization sets the pace
for future efforts to scale up this promising circuit technology.

  Quantum-inspired superresolution methods surpass the Rayleigh limit in
imaging, or the analogous Fourier limit in spectroscopy. This is achieved by
carefully extracting the information carried in the emitted optical field by
engineered measurements. An alternative to complex experimental setups is to
use simple homodyne detection and customized data analysis. We experimentally
investigate this method in the time-frequency domain and demonstrate the
spectroscopic superresolution for two distinct types of light sources: thermal
and phase-averaged coherent states. The experimental results are backed by
theoretical predictions based on estimation theory.

**Kondo effect in the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10569v1)]<br/>Pradip Kattel, Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, J. H. Pixley, Patrick Azaria, Natan Andrei
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We investigate the boundary effects that arise when spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
impurities interact with the edges of the antiferromagnetic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
Heisenberg chain through spin exchange interactions. We consider both cases
when the couplings are ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic. We find that in the
case of antiferromagnetic interaction, when the impurity coupling strength is
much weaker than that in the bulk, the impurity is screened in the ground state
via the Kondo effect. The Kondo phase is characterized by the Lorentzian
density of states and dynamically generated Kondo temperature $T_K$. As the
impurity coupling strength increases, $T_K$ increases until it reaches its
maximum value $T_0=2\pi J$ which is the maximum energy carried by a single
spinon. When the impurity coupling strength is increased further, we enter
another phase, the bound mode phase, where the impurity is screened in the
ground state by a single particle bound mode exponentially localized at the
edge to which the impurity is coupled. We find that the impurity can be
unscreened by removing the bound mode. There exists a boundary eigenstate phase
transition between the Kondo and the bound-mode phases, a transition which is
characterized by the change in the number of towers of the Hilbert space. The
transition also manifests itself in ground state quantities like local impurity
density of states and the local impurity magnetization. When the impurity
coupling is ferromagnetic, the impurity is unscreened in the ground state;
however, when the absolute value of the ratio of the impurity and bulk coupling
strengths is greater than $\frac{4}{5}$, the impurity can be screened by adding
a bound mode that costs energy greater than $T_0$. When two impurities are
considered, the phases exhibited by each impurity remain unchanged in the
thermodynamic limit, but nevertheless the system exhibits a rich phase diagram.

**Continuous Hamiltonian dynamics on digital quantum computers without discretization error**—2023-08-07 (updated: 2023-11-17)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03694v2)]<br/>Etienne Granet, Henrik Dreyer
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We introduce an algorithm to compute Hamiltonian dynamics on digital quantum
computers that requires only a finite circuit depth to reach an arbitrary
precision, i.e. achieves zero discretization error with finite depth. This
finite number of gates comes at the cost of an attenuation of the measured
expectation value by a known amplitude, requiring more shots per circuit. The
gate count for simulation up to time $t$ is $O(t^2\mu^2)$ with $\mu$ the
$1$-norm of the Hamiltonian, without dependence on the precision desired on the
result, providing a significant improvement over previous algorithms. The only
dependence in the norm makes it particularly adapted to non-sparse
Hamiltonians. The algorithm generalizes to time-dependent Hamiltonians,
appearing for example in adiabatic state preparation. These properties make it
particularly suitable for present-day relatively noisy hardware that supports
only circuits with moderate depth.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We address the variational preparation of Gibbs states as the ground state of
a suitably engineered Hamiltonian acting on the doubled Hilbert space. The
construction is exact for quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians and gives excellent
approximations up to fairly high quartic deformations. We provide a variational
circuit whose optimization returns the unitary diagonalizing operator, thus
giving access to the whole spectrum. The problem naturally implements the
entanglement forging ansatz, allowing the computation of Thermofield Doubles
with a higher number of qubits than in competing frameworks.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  A black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. Each mode of that radiation is
thermal. If the total state is nevertheless to be pure, modes must be
entangled. Estimating the minimum size of this entanglement has been an
important outstanding issue. We develop a new theory of constrained random
symplectic transformations, based on that the total state is pure, Gaussian and
random, and every mode thermal as in Hawking theory. From this theory we
compute the distribution of mode-mode correlations, from which we bound
mode-mode entanglement. We find that correlations between thinly populated
modes (early-time high-frequency modes and/or late modes of any frequency) are
strongly suppressed. Such modes are hence very weakly entangled. Highly
populated modes (early-time low-frequency modes) can on the other hand be
strongly correlated, but a detailed analysis reveals that they are nevertheless
also weakly entangled. Our analysis hence establishes that restoring unitarity
after a complete evaporation of a black hole does not require strong quantum
entanglement between any pair of Hawking modes. Our analysis further gives
exact general expressions for the distribution of mode-mode correlations in
random, pure, Gaussian states with given marginals, which may have applications
beyond black hole physics.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The effect of quantum steering describes a possible action at a distance via
local measurements. In the last few years, several criteria have been proposed
in to detect this type of correlation in quantum systems. However, there are a
few approaches presented in order to measure the degree of steerability of a
given system. In this work, we are interested in investigating possible ways to
quantify quantum steering, where we based our analysis on different criteria

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In information theory, we often use intersection and union of the typical
sets to analyze various communication problems. However, in the quantum setting
it is not very clear how to construct a measurement which behaves analogous to
intersection and union of the typical sets. In this work, we construct a
projection operator which behaves very similar to intersection and union of the
typical sets. Our construction relies on the Jordan's lemma. Using this
construction we study the problem of communication over authenticated
classical-quantum channels and derive its capacity. As another application of
our construction, we study the problem of quantum asymmetric composite
hypothesis testing. Further, we also prove a converse for the quantum binary
asymmetric hypothesis testing problem which is arguably very similar in spirit
to the converse given in the Thomas and Cover book for the classical version of
this problem.

**An universal quantum computation scheme with low error diffusion property**—2021-05-15 (updated: 2023-11-17)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07133v7)]<br/>Chen Lin, Guowu Yang, Xiaoyu Song, Marek. A. Perkowski, Xiaoyu Li
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum concatenation code is an effective way to realize fault-tolerant
universal quantum computing. Still, there are many non-fault-tolerant logical
locations at its low encoding level, which thereby increases the probability of
error multiplication and limits the ability that such code to realize a
high-fidelity universal gate library. In this work, we propose a general
framework based on machine learning technology for the decoder design of a
segmented fault-tolerant quantum circuit. Then following this design principle,
we adopt the neural network algorithm to give an optimized decoder for the such
circuit. To assess the effectiveness of our new decoder, we apply it to the
segmented fault-tolerant logical controlled-NOT gates, which act on the tensor
composed of the Steane 7-qubit logical qubit and the Reed-Muller 15-qubit
logical qubit. We simulate these gates under depolarizing noise environment and
compare the gate error thresholds in contrast to the minimal-weight decoder.
Finally, we provide a fault-tolerant universal gate library based on a 33-qubit
non-uniform concatenated code. Furthermore, we offer several level-1 segmented
fault-tolerant locations with optimized decoders to construct a non-Clifford
gate on this code, which has less circuit depth than our existing work.
Meanwhile, we analyze the pseudo-threshold of the universal scheme of this
code.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Large-amplitude squeezed cat and high-quality Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP)
states are powerful resources for quantum error correction. However, previous
schemes in optics are limited to low success probabilities, small amplitudes,
and low squeezing. We overcome these limitations and present scalable schemes
in optics for the deterministic preparation of large-amplitude squeezed cat
states using only Gaussian operations and photon-number measurements. These
states can be bred to prepare high-quality approximate GKP states, showing that
GKP error correction in optics is technically feasible in near-term
experiments.

**Detection of hidden photon dark matter using the direct excitation of transmon qubits**—2022-12-07 (updated: 2023-11-17)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03884v2)]<br/>Shion Chen, Hajime Fukuda, Toshiaki Inada, Takeo Moroi, Tatsumi Nitta, Thanaporn Sichanugrist
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We propose a novel dark matter detection method utilizing the excitation of
superconducting transmon qubits. Assuming the hidden photon dark matter of a
mass of $O(10)\ \mu{\rm eV}$, the classical wave-matter oscillation induces an
effective ac electric field via the small kinetic mixing with the ordinary
photon. This serves as a coherent drive field for a qubit when it is resonant,
evolving it from the ground state towards the first-excited state. We evaluate
the rate of such evolution and observable excitations in the measurements, as
well as the search sensitivity to the hidden photon dark matter. For a selected
mass, one can reach $\epsilon \sim 10^{-12}-10^{-14}$ (where $\epsilon$ is the
kinetic mixing parameter of the hidden photon) with a single standard transmon
qubit. A simple extension to the frequency-tunable SQUID-based transmon enables
the mass scan to cover the whole $4-40\ \mu{\rm eV}$ ($1-10$ GHz) range within
a reasonable length of run time. The sensitivity scalability along the number
of the qubits also makes it a promising platform in accord to the rapid
evolution of the superconducting quantum computer technology.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum coherence is the key resource in quantum technologies including
faster computing, secure communication and advanced sensing. Its quantification
and detection are, therefore, paramount within the context of quantum
information processing. Having certain priori knowledge on the observables may
enhance the efficiency of coherence detection. In this work, we posit that the
trace of the observables is a known quantity. Our investigation confirms that
this assumption indeed extends the scope of coherence detection capabilities.
Utilizing this prior knowledge of the trace of the observables, we establish a
series of coherence detection criteria. We investigate the detection
capabilities of these coherence criteria from diverse perspectives and
ultimately ascertain the existence of four distinct and inequivalent criteria.
These findings contribute to the deepening of our understanding of coherence
detection methodologies, thereby potentially opening new avenues for
advancements in quantum technologies.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We study the self-contained three-qubit quantum refrigerator, with a
three-body interaction enabling cooling of the target qubit, in presence of
baths composed of anharmonic quantum oscillators with Kerr-type nonlinearity.
We show that such baths, locally connected to the three qubits, opens up the
opportunity to implement superior steady-state cooling compared to using
harmonic oscillator baths, aiding in access to the free energy required for
empowering the refrigerator function autonomously. We find that in spite of
providing significant primacy in steady-state cooling, such anharmonic baths do
not impart much edge over using harmonic oscillator baths if one targets
transient cooling. However, we gain access to steady-state cooling in the
parameter region where only transient cooling could be achieved by using
harmonic baths. Subsequently, we also study the scaling of steady-state cooling
advantage and the minimum attainable temperature for varying levels of
anharmonicity present in the bath oscillators. Finally, we analyse heat
currents and coefficients of performance of quantum refrigerators using bath
modes involving Kerr-type nonlinearity, and present a comparison with the case
of using bosonic baths made of simple harmonic oscillators. On the way, we
derive the decay rates in the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad quantum
master equation for Kerr-type anharmonic oscillator baths.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We analyze the radiative forces between two dielectric nanospheres mediated
via the quantum and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in the
presence of an external drive. We generalize the scattering theory description
of fluctuation forces to include external quantum fields, allowing them to be
in an arbitrary quantum state. The known trapping and optical binding
potentials are recovered for an external coherent state. We demonstrate that an
external squeezed vacuum state creates similar potentials to a laser, despite
its zero average intensity. Moreover, Schr\"odinger cat states of the field can
enhance or suppress the optical potential depending on whether they are odd or
even. Considering the nanospheres trapped by optical tweezers, we examine the
total interparticle potential as a function of various experimentally relevant
parameters, such as the field intensity, polarization, and phase of the
trapping lasers. We demonstrate that an appropriate set of parameters could
produce mutual bound states of the two nanospheres with potential depth as
large as $\sim200$ K. Our results are pertinent to ongoing experiments with
trapped nanospheres in the macroscopic quantum regime, paving the way for
engineering interactions among macroscopic quantum systems.

  We experimentally study the properties of a harmonically trapped photon gas
undergoing Bose-Einstein condensation along the dimensional crossover from one

polymer nanostructures provide a harmonic trapping potential for the photon
gas. By varying the aspect ratio of the trap we tune from an isotropic
two-dimensional confinement to an anisotropic, highly elongated one-dimensional
trapping potential. Along this transition, we determine caloric properties of
the photon gas, and find a softening of the second-order Bose-Einstein
condensation phase transition observed in two dimensions to a crossover
behaviour in one dimension.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  This study examines clusterability testing for a signed graph in the
bounded-degree model. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a
quantum algorithm with query complexity $\tilde{O}(N^{1/3})$ for testing
clusterability, which yields a polynomial speedup over the best classical
clusterability tester known [arXiv:2102.07587]. Second, we prove an
$\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{N})$ classical query lower bound for testing
clusterability, which nearly matches the upper bound from [arXiv:2102.07587].
This settles the classical query complexity of clusterability testing, and it
shows that our quantum algorithm has an advantage over any classical algorithm.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum Key Distribution has become a mature quantum technology that has
outgrown dedicated links and is ready to be incorporated into the classical
infrastructure. In this scenario with multiple potential nodes, it is crucial
having efficient ways to allocate the network resources between all the
potential users. We propose a simple method for routing and wavelength
assignment in wavelength multiplexed networks in which classical and quantum
channels coexist. The proposed heuristics take into account the specific
requirements of quantum key distribution and focus on keeping at bay the
contamination of the quantum channels by photons coming from the classical
signals by non-linear processes, among others. These heuristics reduce the
shared path between classical and quantum channels. We show we can reduce the
number of quantum key sequences that must be rejected due to excessive error
rates that cannot guarantee security and compare the results to the usual
classical RWA approach.

  We introduce an efficient and accurate readout measurement scheme for single

for system imperfections and thermal noise within the assignment of the
computational basis. We benchmark our protocol on a quantum device with five
superconducting qubits, testing initial state preparation for single and
two-qubit states and an application of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm
executed on five qubits. Our method shows a substantial reduction of the
readout error and promises advantages for near-term and future quantum devices.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Using a dissipative quantum neural network (DQNN) accompanied by conjugate
layers, we upgrade the performance of the existing quantum auto-encoder (QAE)
network as a quantum denoiser of a noisy m-qubit GHZ state. Our new denoising
architecture requires a much smaller number of learning parameters, which can
decrease the training time, especially when a deep or stacked DQNN is needed to
approach the highest fidelity in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)
era. In QAE, we reduce the connection between the hidden layer's qubits and the
output's qubits to modify the decoder. The Renyi entropy of the hidden and
output qubits' states is analyzed with respect to other qubits during learning
iterations. During the learning process, if the hidden layer remains connected
to the input layers, the network can almost perfectly denoise unseen noisy data
with a different underlying noise distribution using the learning parameters
acquired from training data.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Finding the distribution of the velocities and pressures of a fluid (by
solving the Navier-Stokes equations) is a principal task in the chemical,
energy, and pharmaceutical industries, as well as in mechanical engineering and
the design of pipeline systems. With existing solvers, such as OpenFOAM and
Ansys, simulations of fluid dynamics in intricate geometries are
computationally expensive and require re-simulation whenever the geometric
parameters or the initial and boundary conditions are altered. Physics-informed
neural networks are a promising tool for simulating fluid flows in complex
geometries, as they can adapt to changes in the geometry and mesh definitions,
allowing for generalization across different shapes. We present a hybrid
quantum physics-informed neural network that simulates laminar fluid flows in
3D Y-shaped mixers. Our approach combines the expressive power of a quantum
model with the flexibility of a physics-informed neural network, resulting in a
21% higher accuracy compared to a purely classical neural network. Our findings
highlight the potential of machine learning approaches, and in particular
hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network, for complex shape optimization
tasks in computational fluid dynamics. By improving the accuracy of fluid
simulations in complex geometries, our research using hybrid quantum models
contributes to the development of more efficient and reliable fluid dynamics

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Symmetric states of collective angular momentum are good candidates for
multi-qubit probe states in quantum sensors because they are easy to prepare
and can be controlled without requiring individual addressability. Here, we
give quantum error correction protocols for estimating the magnitude of
classical fields using symmetric probe states. To achieve this, we first
develop a general theory for quantum error correction on the symmetric
subspace. This theory, based on the representation theory of the symmetric
group, allows us to construct efficient algorithms that can correct any
correctible error on any permutation-invariant code. These algorithms involve
measurements of total angular momentum, quantum Schur transforms or logical
state teleportations, and geometric pulse gates. For deletion errors, we give a
simpler quantum error correction algorithm based on primarily on geometric
pulse gates. Second, we devise a simple quantum sensing scheme on symmetric
probe states that works in spite of a linear rate of deletion errors, and
analyze its asymptotic performance. In our scheme, we repeatedly project the
probe state onto the codespace while the signal accumulates. When the time
spent to accumulate the signal is constant, our scheme can do phase estimation
with precision that approaches the best possible in the noiseless setting.
Third, we give near-term implementations of our algorithms.

**Ultra-quantum coherent states in a single finite quantum system**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10429v1)]<br/>A. Vourdas
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  A set of $n$ coherent states is introduced in a quantum system with
$d$-dimensional Hilbert space $H(d)$. It is shown that they resolve the
identity, and also have a discrete isotropy property. A finite cyclic group
acts on the set of these coherent states, and partitions it into orbits. A
$n$-tuple representation of arbitrary states in $H(d)$, analogous to the
Bargmann representation, is defined. There are two other important properties
of these coherent states which make them `ultra-quantum'. The first property is
related to the Grothendieck formalism which studies the `edge' of the Hilbert
space and quantum formalisms. Roughly speaking the Grothendieck theorem
considers a `classical' quadratic form ${\mathfrak C}$ that uses complex
numbers in the unit disc, and a `quantum' quadratic form ${\mathfrak Q}$ that
uses vectors in the unit ball of the Hilbert space. It shows that if
${\mathfrak C}\le 1$, the corresponding ${\mathfrak Q}$ might take values
greater than $1$, up to the complex Grothendieck constant $k_G$. ${\mathfrak
Q}$ related to these coherent states is shown to take values in the
`Grothendieck region' $(1,k_G)$, which is classically forbidden in the sense
that ${\mathfrak C}$ does not take values in it. The second property
complements this, showing that these coherent states violate logical Bell-like
inequalities (which for a single quantum system are quantum versions of the
Frechet probabilistic inequalities). In this sense also, our coherent states
are deep into the quantum region.

Hamiltonian dies off exponentially with distance from the system-environment
boundary. For spin systems, we identify the terms that can appear in the

  Annealing is the process of gradually lowering the temperature of a system to
guide it towards its lowest energy states. In an accompanying paper [Luo et al.
Phys. Rev. E 108, L052105 (2023)], we derived a general bound on annealing
performance by connecting annealing with stochastic thermodynamics tools,
including a speed-limit on state transformation from entropy production. We
here describe the derivation of the general bound in detail. In addition, we
analyze the case of simulated annealing with Glauber dynamics in depth. We show
how to bound the two case-specific quantities appearing in the bound, namely
the activity, a measure of the number of microstate jumps, and the change in
relative entropy between the state and the instantaneous thermal state, which
is due to temperature variation. We exemplify the arguments by numerical
simulations on the SK model of spin-glasses.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Annealing has proven highly successful in finding minima in a cost landscape.
Yet, depending on the landscape, systems often converge towards local minima
rather than global ones. In this Letter, we analyse the conditions for which
annealing is approximately successful in finite time. We connect annealing to
stochastic thermodynamics to derive a general bound on the distance between the
system state at the end of the annealing and the ground state of the landscape.
This distance depends on the amount of state updates of the system and the
accumulation of non-equilibrium energy, two protocol and energy landscape
dependent quantities which we show are in a trade-off relation. We describe how
to bound the two quantities both analytically and physically. This offers a
general approach to assess the performance of annealing from accessible
parameters, both for simulated and physical implementations.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The processing of energy by transfer and redistribution plays a key role in
the evolution of dynamical systems. At the ultrasmall and ultrafast scale of
nanosystems, quantum coherence could in principle also play a role and has been
reported in many pulse-driven nanosystems (e.g. quantum dots and even the
microscopic Light-Harvesting Complex II (LHC-II) aggregate). Typical
theoretical analyses cannot easily be scaled to describe these general
$N$-component nanosystems; they do not treat the pulse dynamically; and they
approximate memory effects. Here our aim is to shed light on what new physics
might arise beyond these approximations. We adopt a purposely minimal model
such that the time-dependence of the pulse is included explicitly in the
Hamiltonian. This simple model generates complex dynamics: specifically, pulses
of intermediate duration generate highly entangled vibronic (i.e.
electronic-vibrational) states that spread multiple excitons -- and hence
energy -- maximally within the system. Subsequent pulses can then act on such
entangled states to efficiently channel subsequent energy capture. The
underlying pulse-generated vibronic entanglement increases in strength and
robustness as $N$ increases.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We propose a novel method to significantly enhance the signal rate in the
qubit-based dark matter detection experiments with the help of quantum
interference. Various quantum sensors possess ideal properties for detecting
wave-like dark matter, and qubits, commonly employed in quantum computers, are
excellent candidates for dark matter detectors. We demonstrate that, by
designing an appropriate quantum circuit to manipulate the qubits, the signal
rate scales proportionally to $n_{\rm q}^2$, with $n_{\rm q}$ being the number
of sensor qubits, rather than linearly with $n_{\rm q}$. Consequently, in the
dark matter detection with a substantial number of sensor qubits, a significant
increase in the signal rate can be expected. We provide a specific example of a
quantum circuit that achieves this enhancement by coherently combining the
phase evolution in each individual qubit due to its interaction with dark
matter. We also demonstrate that the circuit is fault tolerant to de-phasing
noises, a critical quantum noise source in quantum computers. The enhancement
mechanism proposed here is applicable to various modalities for quantum
computers, provided that the quantum operations relevant to enhancing the dark
matter signal can be applied to these devices.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Enhancing the performance of noisy quantum processors requires improving our
understanding of error mechanisms and the ways to overcome them. A judicious
selection of qubit design parameters, guided by an accurate error model, plays
a pivotal role in improving the performance of quantum processors. In this
study, we identify optimal ranges for qubit design parameters, grounded in
comprehensive noise modeling. To this end, we commence by analyzing a
previously unexplored error mechanism that can perturb diabatic two-qubit gates
due to charge-parity switches caused by quasiparticles. We show that such
charge-parity switching can be the dominant quasiparticle-related error source
in a controlled-Z gate between two qubits. Moreover, we also demonstrate that
quasiparticle dynamics, resulting in uncontrolled charge-parity switches,
induce a residual longitudinal interaction between qubits in a tunable-coupler
circuit. Our analysis of optimal design parameters is based on a performance
metric for quantum circuit execution that takes into account the fidelity and
frequencies of the appearance of both single and two-qubit gates in the
circuit. This performance metric together with a detailed noise model enables
us to find an optimal range for the qubit design parameters. Substantiating our
findings through exact numerical simulations, we establish that fabricating
quantum chips within this optimal parameter range not only augments the
performance metric but also ensures its continued improvement with the
enhancement of individual qubit coherence properties. Conversely, straying from
the optimal parameter range can lead to the saturation of the performance
metric. Our systematic analysis offers insights and serves as a guiding
framework for the development of the next generation of transmon-based quantum
processors.

**Quantum Counting by Quantum Walks**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10407v1)]<br/>Gustavo A. Bezerra, Raqueline A. M. Santos, Renato Portugal
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum counting is a key quantum algorithm that aims to determine the number
of marked elements in a database. This algorithm is based on the quantum phase
estimation algorithm and uses the evolution operator of Grover's algorithm
because its non-trivial eigenvalues are dependent on the number of marked
elements. Since Grover's algorithm can be viewed as a quantum walk on a
complete graph, a natural way to extend quantum counting is to use the
evolution operator of quantum-walk-based search on non-complete graphs instead
of Grover's operator. In this paper, we explore this extension by analyzing the
coined quantum walk on the complete bipartite graph with an arbitrary number of
marked vertices. We show that some eigenvalues of the evolution operator depend
on the number of marked vertices and using this fact we show that the quantum
phase estimation can be used to obtain the number of marked vertices. The time
complexity for estimating the number of marked vertices in the bipartite graph
with our algorithm aligns closely with that of the original quantum counting
algorithm.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We propose a generalized qubitization technique for quantum amplitude
estimation (QAE), which is a fundamental technique used in various problems
like quantum simulation and quantum machine learning. Without prior information
on the amplitude, we optimize the number of queries to
$\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{6}\epsilon}\approx 1.28\epsilon^{-1}$, which is exactly a
half compared to the quantum phase estimation based algorithm. We also discuss
how our result improves the performance of quantum expectation value estimation
and quantum nonlinear quantity estimation like the von Neumann entropy.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is one of the powerful computatioinal
approaches to study electron correlation effects in solid-state materials and
molecules. Its practical applicability is, however, limited by the exponential
growth of the many-particle Hilbert space with the number of considered
electronic orbitals. Here, the possibility of a one-to-one mapping between
electronic orbitals and the state of a qubit register suggests a significant
computational advantage for the use of a Quantum Computer (QC) for solving DMFT
models. In this work we present a QC approach to solve a two-site DMFT model
based on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. We discuss the
challenges arising from stochastic errors and suggest a means to overcome
unphysical features in the self-energy. We thereby demonstrate the feasibility
to obtain self-consistent results of the two-site DMFT model based on VQE
simulations with a finite number of shots. We systematically compare results
obtained on simulators with calculations on the IBMQ Ehningen QC hardware.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Relative intensity squeezing (RIS) is emerging as a promising technique for
performing high-precision measurements beyond the shot-noise limit. A commonly
used way to produce RIS in visible/IR range is generating correlated "twin
beams" through four-wave mixing by driving atomic resonances with weak laser
beams. Here, we propose an all-optical strong-field scheme to produce a series
of relative-intensity squeezed high-order harmonic "twin beams". Due to the
nature of high harmonics generation the frequencies of the "twin beams" can
cover a broad range of photon energy. Our proposal paves the way for the
development of nonclassical XUV sources and high precision spectroscopy tools
in strong-field regime.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Determining the optimal fidelity for the transmission of quantum information
over noisy quantum channels is one of the central problems in quantum
information theory. Recently, [Berta-Borderi-Fawzi-Scholz, Mathematical
Programming, 2021] introduced an asymptotically converging semidefinite
programming hierarchy of outer bounds for this quantity. However, the size of
the semidefinite programs (SDPs) grows exponentially with respect to the level
of the hierarchy, thus making their computation unscalable. In this work, by
exploiting the symmetries in the SDP, we show that, for fixed input and output
dimensions of the given quantum channel, we can compute the SDP in polynomial
time in terms of the level of the hierarchy. As a direct consequence of our
result, the optimal fidelity can be approximated with an accuracy of $\epsilon$
in a time that is polynomial in $1/\epsilon$.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The concept of \emph{complexity} has become pivotal in multiple disciplines,
including quantum information, where it serves as an alternative metric for
gauging the chaotic evolution of a quantum state. This paper focuses on
\emph{Krylov complexity}, a specialized form of quantum complexity that offers
an unambiguous and intrinsically meaningful assessment of the spread of a
quantum state over all possible orthogonal bases. Our study is situated in the
context of Gaussian quantum states, which are fundamental to both Bosonic and
Fermionic systems and can be fully described by a covariance matrix. We show
that while the covariance matrix is essential, it is insufficient alone for
calculating Krylov complexity due to its lack of relative phase information.
Our findings suggest that the relative covariance matrix can provide an upper
bound for Krylov complexity for Gaussian quantum states. We also explore the
implications of Krylov complexity for theories proposing complexity as a
candidate for holographic duality by computing Krylov complexity for the
thermofield double States (TFD) and Dirac field.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  This research explores the integration of quantum data embedding techniques
into classical machine learning (ML) algorithms, aiming to assess the
performance enhancements and computational implications across a spectrum of
models. We explore various classical-to-quantum mapping methods, ranging from
basis encoding, angle encoding to amplitude encoding for encoding classical
data, we conducted an extensive empirical study encompassing popular ML
algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector

CatBoost. Our findings reveal that quantum data embedding contributes to
improved classification accuracy and F1 scores, particularly notable in models
that inherently benefit from enhanced feature representation. We observed
nuanced effects on running time, with low-complexity models exhibiting moderate
increases and more computationally intensive models experiencing discernible
changes. Notably, ensemble methods demonstrated a favorable balance between
performance gains and computational overhead. This study underscores the
potential of quantum data embedding in enhancing classical ML models and
emphasizes the importance of weighing performance improvements against
computational costs. Future research directions may involve refining quantum
encoding processes to optimize computational efficiency and exploring
scalability for real-world applications. Our work contributes to the growing
body of knowledge at the intersection of quantum computing and classical
machine learning, offering insights for researchers and practitioners seeking

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Machine learning (ML) models are trained using historical data to classify
new, unseen data. However, traditional computing resources often struggle to
handle the immense amount of data, commonly known as Big Data, within a
reasonable timeframe. Quantum computing (QC) provides a novel approach to
information processing. Quantum algorithms have the potential to process
classical data exponentially faster than classical computing. By mapping
quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms into the quantum mechanical domain,
we can potentially achieve exponential improvements in data processing speed,
reduced resource requirements, and enhanced accuracy and efficiency. In this
article, we delve into both the QC and ML fields, exploring the interplay of
ideas between them, as well as the current capabilities and limitations of
hardware. We investigate the history of quantum computing, examine existing QML
algorithms, and aim to present a simplified procedure for setting up
simulations of QML algorithms, making it accessible and understandable for
readers. Furthermore, we conducted simulations on a dataset using both machine
learning and quantum machine learning approaches. We then proceeded to compare
their respective performances by utilizing a quantum simulator.

**Anomalous criticality with bounded fluctuations and long-range frustration induced by broken time-reversal symmetry**—2022-08-03 (updated: 2023-11-17)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02268v2)]<br/>Jinchen Zhao, Myung-Joong Hwang
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We consider a one-dimensional Dicke lattice with complex photon hopping
amplitudes and investigate the influence of time-reversal symmetry breaking due
to synthetic magnetic fields. We show that, by tuning the total flux threading
the lattice with a periodic boundary condition, the universality class of
superradiant phase transition (SPT) changes from that of the mean-field fully
connected systems to one that features anomalous critical phenomena. The
anomalous SPT exhibits a closing of the energy gap with different critical
exponents on both sides of transition and a discontinuity of correlations and
fluctuation despite it being a second-order phase transition. In the anomalous
normal phase, we find that a non-mean-field critical exponent for the closing
energy gap and nondivergent fluctuations and correlations appear, which we
attribute to the asymmetric dispersion relation. Moreover, we show that the
nearest neighborhood complex hopping induces effective long-range interactions
for position quadratures of the cavity fields, whose competition leads to a
series of first-order phase transitions among superradiant phases with varying
degrees of frustration. The resulting multicritical points also show anomalous
features such as two coexisting critical scalings on both sides of the
transition. Our work shows that the interplay between the broken time-reversal
symmetry and frustration on bosonic lattice systems can give rise to anomalous
critical phenomena that have no counterpart in fermionic, spin, or
time-reversal symmetric quantum optical systems.

**Fast algorithms for classical specifications of stabiliser states and Clifford gates**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10357v1)]<br/>Nadish de Silva, Wilfred Salmon, Ming Yin
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The stabiliser formalism plays a central role in quantum computing, error
correction, and fault-tolerance. Stabiliser states are used to encode quantum
data. Clifford gates are those which can be easily performed fault-tolerantly
in the most common error correction schemes. Their mathematical properties are
the subject of significant research interest.
  Numerical experiments are critical to formulating and testing conjectures
involving the stabiliser formalism. In this note, we provide fast methods for
verifying that a vector is a stabiliser state, and interconverting between its
specification as amplitudes, a quadratic form, and a check matrix. We use these
to rapidly check if a given unitary matrix is a Clifford gate and to convert
between the matrix of a Clifford gate and its compact specification as a
stabiliser tableau.
  We provide implementations of our algorithms in Python that outperform the
best-known brute force methods by some orders of magnitude with asymptotic
improvements that are exponential in the number of qubits.

**Quantifying Subspace Entanglement with Geometric Measures**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10353v1)]<br/>Xuanran Zhu, Chao Zhang, Bei Zeng
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Determining whether a quantum subspace is entangled and quantifying its
entanglement level remains a fundamental challenge in quantum information
science. This paper introduces a geometric measure of $r$-bounded rank,
$E_r(S)$, for a given subspace $S$. This measure, derived from the established
geometric measure of entanglement, is tailored to assess the entanglement
within $S$. It not only provides a benchmark for quantifying the entanglement
level but also sheds light on the subspace's ability to preserve such
entanglement. Utilizing non-convex optimization techniques from the domain of
machine learning, our method effectively calculates $E_r(S)$ in various
scenarios. Showcasing strong performance in comparison to existing hierarchical
and PPT relaxation techniques, our approach is notable for its accuracy,
computational efficiency, and wide-ranging applicability. This versatile and
effective tool paves the way for numerous new applications in quantum
information science. It is particularly useful in validating highly entangled
subspaces in bipartite systems, determining the border rank of multipartite
states, and identifying genuinely or completely entangled subspaces. Our
approach offers a fresh perspective for quantifying entanglement, while also
shedding light on the intricate structure of quantum entanglement.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The violation of detailed balance poses a serious problem for the majority of
current quasiclassical methods for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics. In order
to analyze the severity of the problem, we predict the long-time limits of the
electronic populations according to various quasiclassical mapping approaches,
by applying arguments from classical ergodic theory. Our analysis confirms that
regions of the mapping space that correspond to negative populations, which
most mapping approaches introduce in order to go beyond the Ehrenfest
approximation, pose the most serious issue for reproducing the correct
thermalization behaviour. This is because inverted potentials, which arise from
negative electronic populations entering into the nuclear force, can result in
trajectories unphysically accelerating off to infinity. The recently developed
mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) provides a simple way of avoiding
inverted potentials, while retaining an accurate description of the dynamics.
We prove that MASH, unlike any other quasiclassical approach, is guaranteed to
describe the exact thermalization behaviour of all
quantum$\unicode{x2013}$classical systems, confirming it as one of the most
promising methods for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics in real condensed-phase
systems.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  This study investigates measurement strategies in a scenario where multiple
pairs of Alices and Bobs independently and sequentially observe entangled
states. The aim is to maximize the number of observer pairs $(A_k,B_l)$ that
can witness entanglement. Prior research has demonstrated that arbitrary pairs
$(A_k, B_k)$ ($k\leq n$) can observe entanglement in all pure entangled states
and a specific class of mixed entangled states [Phys. Rev. A 106 032419
(2022)]. However, it should be noted that other pairs $(A_k, B_l)$ with $(k\neq
l \leq n)$ may not observe entanglement using the same strategy. Moreover, a
novel strategy is presented, enabling every pair of arbitrarily many Alices and
Bobs to witness entanglement regardless of the initial state being a Bell state
or a particular class of mixed entangled states. These findings contribute to
understanding measurement strategies for maximizing entanglement observation in
various contexts.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We investigate Landau-Zener (LZ) transitions in the three-level bow-tie model

of multiple Davydov D2 Ansatze. We first consider the 3L-TBM coupled to a
single harmonic mode, study evolutions of the transition probabilities for
selected values of the model parameters, and interpret the obtained results
with the aid of the energy diagram method. We then explore the 3L-TBM coupled
to a boson bath. Our simulations demonstrate that sub-Ohmic, Ohmic and
super-Ohmic boson baths have substantially different influences on the 3L-BTM
dynamics, which cannot be grasped by the standard phenomenological Markovian
single-rate descriptions. We also describe novel bath-induced phenomena which

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We show how to utilize magnetostriction to synchronize two mechanical
vibration modes in a cavity magnomechanical system. The dispersive
magnetostrictive interaction provides necessary nonlinearity required for
achieving synchronization. Strong phase correlation between two mechanical
oscillators can be established, leading to the synchronization robust against
thermal noise. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the
synchronization by solving the constraint conditions of steady-state limit
cycles. We determine that the strong cavity-magnon linear coupling can enhance
and regulate the synchronization, which offers a new path to modulate
synchronization. The work reveals a new mechanism for achieving and modulating
synchronization and indicates that cavity magnomechanical systems can be an
ideal platform to explore rich synchronization phenomena.

**Topological Discrimination of Steep to Supersteep Gap to Emergence of Tunneling in Adiabatic Quantum Processes**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10333v1)]<br/>Edmond Jonckheere
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  It is shown that the gap that limits the speed of a quantum annealing process
can take three salient morphologies: (i) the supersteep gap where both the
ground and the first excited eigenenergy level curves have topologically
related pairs of nearby inflection points giving both the maximum and the
minimum a steep aspect, (ii) the steep gap where only the first excited
eigenenergy level curve has a pair of inflection points giving its minimum a
steep aspect while the maximum of the ground level does not exhibit inflection
points, and (iii) the mild gap that has no related inflection points.
Classification of the various singularities betrayed by the inflection points
relies on the critical value curves of the quadratic numerical range mapping of
the matrix H0+iH1, where H0 is the transverse field Hamiltonian and H1 the
problem Hamiltonian. It is shown that the ground level is mapped to the
generically smooth boundary of the numerical range, while the first excited
level is mapped to an interior non-smooth critical value curve exhibiting
swallow tails. The major result is that the position of the swallow tails
relative to the boundary allows the supersteep versus steep discrimination,
while the absence of swallow tail-boundary interaction characterizes the mild
gap. As a corollary of the singularity analysis, the highly structured initial
and final Hamiltonians of the Grover search create unstable singularities that
break into stable swallow tails under perturbation, with the consequence of
invalidating the gap scaling estimates computed around the unstable
singularity. Classification of all stable singularities from a global viewpoint
requires the Legendrian approach where the energy level curves become
Legendrian knots in the contact space. Last but not least, it will be shown
that a supersteep swallow tail previews tunneling.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum state tomography (QST) is the process of reconstructing the state of
a quantum system (mathematically described as a density matrix) through a
series of different measurements, which can be solved by learning a
parameterized function to translate experimentally measured statistics into
physical density matrices. However, the specific structure of quantum
measurements for characterizing a quantum state has been neglected in previous
work. In this paper, we explore the similarity between highly structured
sentences in natural language and intrinsically structured measurements in QST.
To fully leverage the intrinsic quantum characteristics involved in QST, we
design a quantum-aware transformer (QAT) model to capture the complex
relationship between measured frequencies and density matrices. In particular,
we query quantum operators in the architecture to facilitate informative
representations of quantum data and integrate the Bures distance into the loss
function to evaluate quantum state fidelity, thereby enabling the
reconstruction of quantum states from measured data with high fidelity.
Extensive simulations and experiments (on IBM quantum computers) demonstrate
the superiority of the QAT in reconstructing quantum states with favorable
robustness against experimental noise.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We present a no-go theorem for the distinguishability between quantum random
numbers (i.e., random numbers generated quantum mechanically) and pseudo-random
numbers (i.e., random numbers generated algorithmically). The theorem states
that one cannot distinguish these two types of random numbers if the quantum
random numbers are efficiently classically simulatable and the randomness
measure used for the distinction is efficiently computable. We derive this
theorem by using the properties of cryptographic pseudo-random number
generators, which are believed to exist in the field of cryptography. Our
theorem is found to be consistent with the analyses on the actual data of
quantum random numbers generated by the IBM Quantum and also those obtained in
the Innsbruck experiment for the Bell test, where the degrees of randomness of
these two set of quantum random numbers turn out to be essentially
indistinguishable from those of the corresponding pseudo-random numbers.
Previous observations on the algorithmic randomness of quantum random numbers
are also discussed and reinterpreted in terms of our theorems and data
analyses.

**Cohernece in permutation-invariant state enhances permutation-asymmetry**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10307v1)]<br/>Masahito Hayashi
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  A Dicke state and its decohered state are invariant for permutation. However,
when another qubits state to each of them is attached, the whole state is not
invariant for permutation, and has a certain asymmetry for permutation. The
amount of asymmetry can be measured by the number of distinguishable states
under the group action or the mutual information. This paper investigates how
the coherence of a Dicke state affects the amount of asymmetry. To address this
problem asymptotically, we introduce a new type of central limit theorem by
using several formulas on hypergeometric functions. We reveal that the amount
of the asymmetry in the case with a Dicke state has a strictly larger order
than that with the decohered state in a specific type of the limit.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Recent experiments have reported that novel physics emerge in open quantum
many-body systems due to an interplay of interactions and dissipation, which
stimulate theoretical studies of the many-body Lindblad equation. Although the
strong dissipation regime receives considerable interest in this context, this
work focuses on the weak bulk dissipation. By examining the spectral property
of the many-body Lindblad generator, we find that its spectral gap generically
shows singularity in the weak dissipation limit when the thermodynamic limit is
taken first. Such singular behavior is related to the concept of the
Ruelle-Pollicott resonance in chaos theory, which determines the timescale of
thermalization of an isolated system. Thus, the many-body Lindblad equation in
the weak dissipation regime contains nontrivial information on intrinsic
properties of a quantum many-body system.

  Combinatorial optimization is a broadly attractive area for potential quantum

hardware remains a challenge, and more sophisticated quantum-classical
algorithms are required to bolster their performance. Here, we introduce an
iterative quantum heuristic optimization algorithm to solve combinatorial

solving paradigmatic Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising spin glass problems. We find
the quantum algorithm systematically outperforms its classical greedy
counterpart, signaling a quantum enhancement. Moreover, we observe an absolute
performance comparable with a state-of-the-art semidefinite programming method.
Classical simulations of the algorithm illustrate that a key challenge to
reaching quantum advantage remains improving the quantum device

purification, besides the cases of successful purification, the recurrence MEPP
actually has the reusable discarded items which are usually regarded as a
failure. Our protocol contains two parts for bit-flip error correction. The
first one is the conventional MEPP, corresponding successful cases. The second
one includes two efficient approaches, recycling purification with entanglement
link and direct residual entanglement purification, that can utilize discarded
items. We also make a comparison between two approaches. Which method to use
depends on initial input states, and in most cases the approach of direct
residual purification is optimal for it not only may obtain a higher fidelity
entangled state but also it does not require additional sophisticated links. In
addition, for phase-flip errors, the discarded items still have available
residual entanglement in the case of different input states. With these
approaches, this MEPP has a higher efficiency than all previous MEPPs and it
may have potential applications in the future long-distance quantum
communications and networks.

**Resonance of Geometric Quantities and Hidden Symmetry in the Asymmetric Rabi Model**—2023-11-17—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10249v1)]<br/>Qinjing Yu, Zhiguo Lü
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We present the interesting resonance of two kinds of geometric quantities,
namely the Aharonov-Anandan (AA) phase and the time-energy uncertainty, and
reveal the relation between resonance and the hidden symmetry in the asymmetric
Rabi model by numerical and analytical methods. By combining the
counter-rotating hybridized rotating-wave method with time-dependent
perturbation theory, we solve systematically the time evolution operator and
then obtain the geometric phase of the Rabi model. In comparison with the
numerically exact solutions, we find that the analytical results accurately
describe the geometric quantities in a wide parameter space. We unveil the
effect of the bias on the resonance of geometric quantities, (1) the positions
of all harmonic resonances stemming from the shift of the Rabi frequency at the
presence of the bias; (2) the occurrence of even order harmonic resonance due
to the bias. When the driving frequency is equal to the subharmonics of the
bias, the odd higher-order harmonic resonances disappear. Finally, the hidden
symmetry has a resemblance to that of the quantum Rabi model with bias, which
indicates the quasienergy spectra are similar to the energy spectra of the
latter.

**Quantum Public-Key Encryption with Tamper-Resilient Public Keys from One-Way Functions**—2023-04-04 (updated: 2023-11-17)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01800v3)]<br/>Fuyuki Kitagawa, Tomoyuki Morimae, Ryo Nishimaki, Takashi Yamakawa
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We construct quantum public-key encryption from one-way functions. In our
construction, public keys are quantum, but ciphertexts are classical. Quantum
public-key encryption from one-way functions (or weaker primitives such as
pseudorandom function-like states) are also proposed in some recent works
[Morimae-Yamakawa, eprint:2022/1336; Coladangelo, eprint:2023/282;
Barooti-Grilo-Malavolta-Sattath-Vu-Walter, eprint:2023/877]. However, they have
a huge drawback: they are secure only when quantum public keys can be
transmitted to the sender (who runs the encryption algorithm) without being
tampered with by the adversary, which seems to require unsatisfactory physical
setup assumptions such as secure quantum channels. Our construction is free
from such a drawback: it guarantees the secrecy of the encrypted messages even
if we assume only unauthenticated quantum channels. Thus, the encryption is
done with adversarially tampered quantum public keys. Our construction is the
first quantum public-key encryption that achieves the goal of classical
public-key encryption, namely, to establish secure communication over insecure
channels, based only on one-way functions. Moreover, we show a generic compiler
to upgrade security against chosen plaintext attacks (CPA security) into
security against chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA security) only using one-way
functions. As a result, we obtain CCA secure quantum public-key encryption
based only on one-way functions.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We show that squeezing is a crucial resource for interferometers based on the
spatial separation of ultra-cold interacting matter. Atomic interactions lead
to a general limitation for the precision of these atom interferometers, which
can neither be surpassed by larger atom numbers nor by conventional phase or
number squeezing. However, tailored squeezed states allow to overcome this
sensitivity bound by anticipating the major detrimental effect that arises from
the interactions. We envisage applications in future high-precision
differential matter-wave interferometers, in particular gradiometers, e.g., for
gravitational-wave detection.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Phonons traveling in solid-state devices are emerging as a universal
excitation that can couple to different physical systems through mechanical
interaction. At microwave frequencies and in solid-state materials, phonons
have a similar wavelength to optical photons, enabling them to interact
efficiently with light and produce strong optomechanical effects that are
highly desirable for classical and quantum signal transduction between optical
and microwave. It becomes conceivable to build optomechanical integrated
circuits (OMIC) that guide both photons and phonons and interconnect discrete
photonic and phononic devices. Here, we demonstrate an OMIC including an
optomechanical ring resonator (OMR), in which infrared photons and GHz phonons
co-resonate to induce significantly enhanced interconversion. The OMIC is built
on a hybrid platform where wide bandgap semiconductor gallium phosphide (GaP)
is used as the waveguiding material and piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) is used
for phonon generation. The OMR features photonic and phononic quality factors
of $>1\times10^5$ and $3.2\times10^3$, respectively, and resonantly enhances
the optomechanical conversion between photonic modes to achieve an internal
conversion efficiency $\eta_i=(2.1\pm0.1)%$ and a total device efficiency
$\eta_{tot}=0.57\times10^{-6}$ at a low acoustic pump power of 1.6 mW. The
efficient conversion in OMICs enables microwave-optical transduction for many
applications in quantum information processing and microwave photonics.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Symmetry is an important and unifying notion in many areas of physics. In
quantum mechanics, it is possible to eliminate degrees of freedom from a system
by leveraging symmetry to identify the possible physical transitions. This
allows us to simplify calculations and characterize potentially complicated
dynamics of the system with relative ease. Previous works have focused on
devising quantum algorithms to ascertain symmetries by means of fidelity-based
symmetry measures. In our present work, we develop alternative symmetry testing
quantum algorithms that are efficiently implementable on quantum computers. Our
approach estimates asymmetry measures based on the Hilbert--Schmidt distance,
which is significantly easier, in a computational sense, than using fidelity as
a metric. The method is derived to measure symmetries of states, channels,
Lindbladians, and measurements. We apply this method to a number of scenarios
involving open quantum systems, including the amplitude damping channel and a
spin chain, and we test for symmetries within and outside the finite symmetry
group of the Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators.

**Application of the Fourth-Order Time Convolutionless Master Equation to Open Quantum Systems: Quantum Limit of 1/f-Noise**—2023-10-23 (updated: 2023-11-16)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15089v2)]<br/>Elyana Crowder, Lance Lampert, Grihith Manchanda, Brian Shoffeitt, Srikar Gadamsetty, Yiting Pei, Shantanu Chaudhary, Dragomir Davidović
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We optimize and simplify the exact 4th-order time-convolutionless master
equation (TCL4), in a dense set of open quantum systems weakly coupled to the
bath. The master equation has a term proportional to the derivative of the
system's spectral density and exhibits $1/f^{1-s}$ noise at zero temperature in
the thermodynamic limit. $s$ is the power law in the spectral density at a
small frequency $f$ and the noise approaches $1/f$ noise when $s\to 0_+$. The
noise is driven by the fourth-order relaxation-dephasing hybrid processes. When
$s<1$, the reduced dynamics diverges in the long time limit. However, by
imposing a physical infrared cut-off time, we estimate the entanglement entropy
between the small quantum system (hard matter) and the emitted soft bosons in
the bath (soft matter). We also examine how the master equation represents the
approach to a ground state, by comparing the asymptotic states of the dynamics
at zero temperature and ground states, both computed to fourth order in the
interaction. We find that the approach to ground state is numerically exact
only in the second order of coupling to the bath. The TCL4 master equation
embodies the infrared problem from quantum field theory, opening up
possibilities to mitigate infrared divergent noise in quantum computing and to
study its impact on the efficiency of photosynthetic light harvesting.

**Mimicking Classical Noise in Ion Channels by Quantum Decoherence**—2023-11-16—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10222v1)]<br/>Mina Seifi, Ali Soltanmanesh, Afshin Shafiee
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The mechanism of selectivity in ion channels is still an open question in
biology. According to recent proposals, it seems that the selectivity filter of
the ion channel, which plays a key role in the channel's function, may show
quantum coherence, which can play a role in explaining the selection mechanism
and conduction of ions. However, due to decoherence theory, the presence of
environmental noise causes decoherence and loss of quantum effects. Sometimes
we hope that the effect of calssical noise of the environment in ion channels
can be modeled through a picture whose the quantum decoherence theory presents.
In this paper, we simulated the behavior of the ion channel system in the
Spin-Boson model using the unitary evolution of a stochastic Hamiltonian
operator under the classical noise model. Also, in a different approach, we
modeled the system evolution as a two-level Spin-Boson model with tunneling
interacting with a bath of harmonic oscillators, using decoherence theory. The
results of this system were discussed in different classical and quantum
regimes. By examining the results it was found that the Spin-Boson model at a
high hopping rate of Potassium ions can simulate the behavior of the system in
the classical noise approach. This result is another proof for the fact that
ion channels need high speed for high selectivity.

**Scattering with Neural Operators**—2023-08-28 (updated: 2023-11-16)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14789v2)]<br/>Sebastian Mizera

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Recent advances in machine learning establish the ability of certain
neural-network architectures called neural operators to approximate maps
between function spaces. Motivated by a prospect of employing them in
fundamental physics, we examine applications to scattering processes in quantum
mechanics. We use an iterated variant of Fourier neural operators to learn the
physics of Schr\"odinger operators, which map from the space of initial wave
functions and potentials to the final wave functions. These deep operator
learning ideas are put to test in two concrete problems: a neural operator
predicting the time evolution of a wave packet scattering off a central
potential in $1+1$ dimensions, and the double-slit experiment in $2+1$
dimensions. At inference, neural operators can become orders of magnitude more
efficient compared to traditional finite-difference solvers.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Dynamical quantum phase transition is a critical phenomenon involving
out-of-equilibrium states and broken symmetries without classical analogy.
However, when finite-sized systems are analyzed, dynamical singularities of the
rate function can appear, leading to a challenging physical characterization
when parameters are changed. Here, we report a quantum support vector machine
(QSVM) algorithm that uses quantum Kernels to classify dynamical singularities
of the rate function for a multiqubit system. We illustrate our approach using
$N$ long-range interacting qubits subjected to an arbitrary magnetic field,
which induces a quench dynamics. Inspired by physical arguments, we introduce
two different quantum Kernels, one inspired by the ground state manifold and
the other based on a single state tomography. Our accuracy and adaptability
results show that this quantum dynamical critical problem can be efficiently
solved using physically inspiring quantum Kernels. Moreover, we extend our
results for the case of time-dependent fields, quantum master equation, and
when we increase the number of qubits.

**Quantum tomography of magnons using Brillouin light scattering**—2023-11-16—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10152v1)]<br/>Sanchar Sharma, Silvia Viola Kusminskiy, Victor ASV Bittencourt
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum magnonics, an emerging field focusing on the study of magnons for
quantum applications, requires precise measurement methods capable of resolving
single magnons. Existing techniques introduce additional dissipation channels
and are not apt for magnets in free space. Brillouin light scattering (BLS) is
a well-established technique for probing the magnetization known for its high
sensitivity and temporal resolution. The coupling between magnons and photons
is controlled by a laser input, so it can be switched off when a measurement is
not needed. In this article, we theoretically investigate the efficacy of BLS
for quantum tomography of magnons. We model a finite optomagnonic waveguide,
including the optical noise added by the dielectric, to calculate the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We find that the SNR is typically low due to a
small magneto-optical coupling; nevertheless, it can be significantly enhanced
by injecting squeezed vacuum into the waveguide. We reconstruct the density
matrix of the magnons from the statistics of the output photons using a maximum
likelihood estimate. The classical component of a magnon state, defined as the
regions of positive Wigner function, can be reconstructed with a high accuracy
while the non-classical component necessitates either a higher SNR or a larger
dataset. The latter requires more compact data structures and advanced
algorithms for post-processing. The SNR is limited partially by the input laser
power that can be increased by designing the optomagnonic cavity with a heat
sink.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In various chaotic quantum many-body systems, the ground states show
non-trivial athermal behavior despite the bulk states exhibiting
thermalization. Such athermal states play a crucial role in quantum information
theory and its applications. Moreover, any generic quantum many-body system in
the Krylov basis is represented by a tridiagonal Lanczos Hamiltonian, which is
analogous to the matrices from the $\beta$ ensemble, a well-studied random
matrix model with level repulsion tunable via the parameter $\beta$. Motivated
by this, here we focus on the localization properties of the ground and
anti-ground states of the $\beta$ ensemble. Both analytically and numerically,
we show that both the edge states demonstrate non-ergodic (fractal) properties
for $\beta\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ while the typical bulk states are ergodic.
Surprisingly, the fractal dimension of the edge states remain three time
smaller than that of the bulk states irrespective of the global phase of the
$\beta$ ensemble. In addition to the fractal dimensions, we also consider the
distribution of the localization centers of the spectral edge states, their
mutual separation, as well as the spatial and correlation properties of the
first excited states.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We introduce the Dunkl-Darboux III oscillator Hamiltonian in N dimensions,
defined as a $\lambda-$deformation of the N-dimensional Dunkl oscillator. This
deformation can be interpreted either as the introduction of a non-constant
curvature related to $\lambda$ on the underlying space or, equivalently, as a
Dunkl oscillator with a position-dependent mass function. This new quantum
model is shown to be exactly solvable in arbitrary dimension N, and its
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are explicitly presented. Moreover, it is shown
that in the two-dimensional case both the Darboux III and the Dunkl oscillators
can be separately coupled with a constant magnetic field, thus giving rise to
two new exactly solvable quantum systems in which the effect of a
position-dependent mass and the Dunkl derivatives on the structure of the
Landau levels can be explicitly studied. Finally, the whole 2D Dunkl-Darboux
III oscillator is coupled with the magnetic field and shown to define an
exactly solvable Hamiltonian, where the interplay between the
$\lambda$-deformation and the magnetic field is explicitly illustrated.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this paper we study single qutrit quantum circuits consisting of words
over the Clifford+ $\mathcal{D}$ gate set, where $\mathcal{D}$ consists of
cyclotomic gates of the form $\text{diag}(\pm\xi^{a},\pm\xi^{b},\pm\xi^{c}),$
where $\xi$ is a primitive $9$-th root of unity and $a,b,c$ are integers. We
characterize classes of qutrit unit vectors $z$ with entries in
$\mathbb{Z}[\xi, \frac{1}{\chi}]$ based on the possibility of reducing their
smallest denominator exponent (sde) with respect to $\chi := 1 - \xi,$ by
acting an appropriate gate in Clifford+$\mathcal{D}$. We do this by studying
the notion of `derivatives mod $3$' of an arbitrary element of
$\mathbb{Z}[\xi]$ and using it to study the smallest denominator exponent of
$HDz$ where $H$ is the qutrit Hadamard gate and $D \in \mathcal{D}.$ In
addition, we reduce the problem of finding all unit vectors of a given sde to
that of finding integral solutions of a positive definite quadratic form along
with some additional constraints. As a consequence we prove that the Clifford +
$\mathcal{D}$ gates naturally arise as gates with sde $0$ and $3$ in the group
$U(3,\mathbb{Z}[\xi, \frac{1}{\chi}])$ of $3 \times 3$ unitaries with entries
in $\mathbb{Z}[\xi, \frac{1}{\chi}]$

**Observation of the non-Hermitian skin effect and Fermi skin on a digital quantum computer**—2023-11-16—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10143v1)]<br/>Ruizhe Shen, Tianqi Chen, Bo Yang, Ching Hua Lee
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Non-Hermitian physics has attracted considerable attention in the recent
years, in particular the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) for its extreme
sensitivity and non-locality. While the NHSE has been physically observed in
various classical metamaterials and even ultracold atomic arrays, its
highly-nontrivial implications in many-body dynamics have never been
experimentally investigated. In this work, we report the first observation of
the NHSE on a universal quantum processor, as well as its characteristic but
elusive Fermi skin from many-fermion statistics. To implement NHSE dynamics on
a quantum computer, the effective time-evolution circuit not only needs to be
non-reciprocal and non-unitary, but must also be scaled up to a sufficient
number of lattice qubits to achieve spatial non-locality. We show how such a
non-unitary operation can be systematically realized by post-selecting multiple
ancilla qubits, as demonstrated through two paradigmatic non-reciprocal models
on a noisy IBM quantum processor, with clear signatures of asymmetric spatial
propagation and many-body Fermi skin accumulation. To minimize errors from
inevitable device noise, time evolution is performed using a trainable
optimized quantum circuit produced with variational quantum algorithms. Our
study represents a critical milestone in the quantum simulation of
non-Hermitian lattice phenomena on present-day quantum computers, and can be
readily generalized to more sophisticated many-body models with the remarkable
programmability of quantum computers.

**Optimal twirling depths for shadow tomography in the presence of noise**—2023-11-16—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10137v1)]<br/>Pierre-Gabriel Rozon, Ning Bao, Kartiek Agarwal
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The classical shadows protocol is an efficient strategy for estimating
properties of an unknown state $\rho$ using a small number of state copies and
measurements. In its original form, it involves twirling the state with
unitaries from some ensemble and measuring the twirled state in a fixed basis.
It was recently shown that for computing local properties, optimal sample
complexity (copies of the state required) is remarkably achieved for unitaries
drawn from shallow depth circuits composed of local entangling gates, as
opposed to purely local (zero depth) or global twirling (infinite depth)
ensembles. Here we consider the sample complexity as a function of the depth of
the circuit, in the presence of noise. We find that this noise has important
implications for determining the optimal twirling ensemble. Under fairly
general conditions, we i) show that any single-site noise can be accounted for
using a depolarizing noise channel with an appropriate damping parameter $f$;
ii) compute thresholds $f_{\text{th}}$ at which optimal twirling reduces to
local twirling for arbitrary operators and iii) $n^{\text{th}}$ order Renyi
entropies ($n \ge 2$); and iv) provide a meaningful upper bound
$t_{\text{max}}$ on the optimal circuit depth for any finite noise strength
$f$, which applies to all operators and entanglement entropy measurements.
These thresholds strongly constrain the search for optimal strategies to
implement shadow tomography and can be easily tailored to the experimental
system at hand.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We study the directed transport of bosons along a one dimensional lattice in
a dissipative setting, where the hopping is only facilitated by coupling to a
Markovian reservoir. By combining numerical simulations with a field-theoretic
analysis, we investigate the current fluctuations for this process and
determine its asymptotic behavior. These findings demonstrate that dissipative
bosonic transport belongs to the KPZ universality class and therefore, in spite
of the drastic difference in the underlying particle statistics, it features
the same coarse grained behavior as the corresponding asymmetric simple
exclusion process (ASEP) for fermions. However, crucial differences between the
two processes emerge when focusing on the full counting statistics of current
fluctuations. By mapping both models to the physics of fluctuating interfaces,
we find that dissipative transport of bosons and fermions can be understood as
surface growth and erosion processes, respectively. Within this unified
description, both the similarities and discrepancies between the full counting
statistics of the transport are reconciled. Beyond purely theoretical interest,
these findings are relevant for experiments with cold atoms or long-lived
quasi-particles in nanophotonic lattices, where such transport scenarios can be
realized.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We suggest a new indicator of quantum chaos based on the logarithmic
out-of-time-order correlator. On the one hand, this indicator correctly
reproduces the average classical Lyapunov exponent in the semiclassical limit
and directly links the definitions of quantum chaos and classical K-system. On
the other hand, it can be analytically calculated using the replica trick and
the Schwinger-Keldysh diagram technique on a $2n$-fold Keldysh contour. To
illustrate this approach, we consider several one-dimensional systems,
including the quantum cat map, and three paradigmatic large-$N$ models,
including the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Furthermore, we find that correlations
between replicas can reduce the magnitude of the Lyapunov exponent compared to
estimates based on conventional out-of-time-order correlators.

**Entanglement buffering with two quantum memories**—2023-11-16—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10052v1)]<br/>Bethany Davies, Álvaro G. Iñesta, Stephanie Wehner
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum networks crucially rely on the availability of high-quality entangled
pairs of qubits, known as entangled links, distributed across distant nodes.
Maintaining the quality of these links is a challenging task due to the
presence of time-dependent noise, also known as decoherence. Entanglement
purification protocols offer a solution by converting multiple low-quality
entangled states into a smaller number of higher-quality ones. In this work, we
introduce a framework to analyse the performance of entanglement buffering
setups that combine entanglement consumption, decoherence, and entanglement
purification. We propose two key metrics: the availability, which is the
steady-state probability that an entangled link is present, and the average
consumed fidelity, which quantifies the steady-state quality of consumed links.
We then investigate a two-node system, where each node possesses two quantum
memories: one for long-term entanglement storage, and another for entanglement
generation. We model this setup as a continuous-time stochastic process and
derive analytical expressions for the performance metrics. Our findings unveil
a trade-off between the availability and the average consumed fidelity. We also
bound these performance metrics for a buffering system that employs the
well-known bilocal Clifford purification protocols. Importantly, our analysis
demonstrates that, in the presence of noise, consistently purifying the
buffered entanglement increases the average consumed fidelity, even when some
buffered entanglement is discarded due to purification failures.

conditions for convergence of the considered Lindblad equations; our setting
accommodates the case where steady states are not unique but rather supported
on a given subspace of the underlying Hilbert space. We apply our result to a

qubits, a system that received considerable attention in recent years due to
its potential applications in quantum information processing.

  We study the problem of learning the Hamiltonian of a many-body quantum
system from experimental data. We show that the rate of learning depends on the
amount of control available during the experiment. We consider three control
models: one where time evolution can be augmented with instantaneous quantum
operations, one where the Hamiltonian itself can be augmented by adding
constant terms, and one where the experimentalist has no control over the
system's time evolution. With continuous quantum control, we provide an
adaptive algorithm for learning a many-body Hamiltonian at the Heisenberg
limit: $T = \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, where $T$ is the total amount of time
evolution across all experiments and $\epsilon$ is the target precision. This
requires only preparation of product states, time-evolution, and measurement in
a product basis. In the absence of quantum control, we prove that learning is
standard quantum limited, $T = \Omega(\epsilon^{-2})$, for large classes of
many-body Hamiltonians, including any Hamiltonian that thermalizes via the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. These results establish a quadratic
advantage in experimental runtime for learning with quantum control.

**Efficient quantum algorithm to simulate open systems through the quantum noise formalism**—2023-11-16—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10009v1)]<br/>Giovanni Di Bartolomeo, Michele Vischi, Tommaso Feri, Angelo Bassi, Sandro Donadi
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We introduce an efficient algorithm based on the quantum noise framework for
simulating open quantum systems on quantum devices. We prove that the open
system dynamics can be simulated by repeatedly applying random unitary gates
acting on the system qubits plus a single ancillary bath qubit representing the
environment. This algorithm represents a notable step forward compared to
current approaches, not only beacause the ancilla overhead remains always
constant regardless of the system size, but also because it provides a
perturbative approximation of the full Lindblad equation to first order in the
environment coupling constants, allowing to reach a better target accuracy with
respect to first order approximation in the time step, thus reducing the total
number of steps. When the perturbative approximation does not hold one can take
smaller time steps and the approach reduces to the solution to first order in
the time step. As a future perspective, this framework easily accomodates
non-Markovian effects by relaxing the reset of the bath qubit prescription.

**Finite-temperature vibronic spectra from the split-operator thermofield coherence dynamics**—2023-11-16—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10004v1)]<br/>Zhan Tong Zhang, Jiří Vaníček
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The inclusion of temperature effects is important to properly simulate and
interpret experimentally observed vibrationally resolved electronic spectra. We
present a numerically exact approach for evaluating these spectra at finite
temperature using the thermofield coherence dynamics. In this method, which
avoids implementing an algorithm for solving the von Neumann equation for the
coherence, the thermal vibrational ensemble is first mapped to a pure-state
wavepacket in an augmented space, and this wavepacket is then propagated by
solving the standard, zero-temperature Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the
split-operator Fourier method. We show that the finite-temperature spectra
obtained with the thermofield coherence dynamics in a Morse potential agree
exactly with those computed by Boltzmann-averaging the spectra of individual
vibrational levels. Because the split-operator thermofield dynamics on a full
tensor-product grid is restricted to low-dimensional systems, we briefly
discuss how the accessible dimensionality can be increased by various
techniques developed for the zero-temperature split-operator Fourier method.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In recent years, strong expectations have been raised for the possible power
of quantum computing for solving difficult optimization problems, based on
theoretical, asymptotic worst-case bounds. Can we expect this to have
consequences for Linear and Integer Programming when solving instances of
practically relevant size, a fundamental goal of Mathematical Programming,
Operations Research and Algorithm Engineering? Answering this question faces a
crucial impediment: The lack of sufficiently large quantum platforms prevents
performing real-world tests for comparison with classical methods.
  In this paper, we present a quantum analog for classical runtime analysis
when solving real-world instances of important optimization problems. To this
end, we measure the expected practical performance of quantum computers by
analyzing the expected gate complexity of a quantum algorithm. The lack of
practical quantum platforms for experimental comparison is addressed by hybrid
benchmarking, in which the algorithm is performed on a classical system,
logging the expected cost of the various subroutines that are employed by the
quantum versions. In particular, we provide an analysis of quantum methods for
Linear Programming, for which recent work has provided asymptotic speedup
through quantum subroutines for the Simplex method. We show that a practical
quantum advantage for realistic problem sizes would require quantum gate
operation times that are considerably below current physical limitations.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Integrated photonic systems provide a flexible platform where artificial
lattices can be engineered in a reconfigurable fashion. Here, we show that
one-dimensional photonic arrays with engineered losses allow realizing
topological excitation stemming from non-Hermiticity and bulk mode criticality.
We show that a generalized modulation of the local photonic losses allow
creating topological modes both in the presence of periodicity and even in the
quasiperiodic regime. We demonstrate that a localization transition of all the
bulk photonic modes can be engineered in the presence of a quasiperiodic loss
modulation, and we further demonstrate that such a transition can be created in
the presence of both resonance frequency modulation and loss modulation. We
finally address the robustness of this phenomenology to the presence of higher
neighbor couplings and disorder in the emergence of criticality and topological
modes. Our results put forward a strategy to engineer topology and criticality
solely from engineered losses in a photonic system, establishing a potential
platform to study the impact of non-linearities in topological and critical
photonic matter.

**Path distributions for describing eigenstates of orbital angular momentum**—2023-08-05 (updated: 2023-11-16)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02884v3)]<br/>Randall M. Feenstra
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The manner in which probability amplitudes of paths sum up to form wave
functions of orbital angular momentum eigenstates is described. Using a
generalization of stationary-phase analysis, distributions are derived that
provide a measure of how paths contribute towards any given eigenstate. In the
limit of long travel-time, these distributions turn out to be real-valued,
non-negative functions of a momentum variable that describes classical travel
between the endpoints of a path (with the paths explicitly including
nonclassical ones, described in terms of elastica). The distributions are
functions of both this characteristic momentum as well as a polar angle that
provides a tilt, relative to the z-axis of the chosen coordinate system, of the
geodesic that connects the endpoints. The resulting description provides a
replacement for the well-known "vector model" for describing orbital angular
momentum, and importantly, it includes treatment of the case when the quantum
number $\ell$ is zero (i.e., s-states).

**Effect of radiation from vacuum in the interaction of zero-point fluctuations with charged particles accelerated in electric or magnetic fields**—2023-11-16—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10783v1)]<br/>Ya. B. Ulanovsky, A. M. Frolov
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The possibility of the effect of electromagnetic radiation (hereinafter -
radiation from vacuum) due to the interaction of zero-point vacuum fluctuations
with free charged particles accelerated at relativistic speeds in electric or
magnetic fields is theoretically demonstrated and confirmed by calculations.
The proposed effect is similar to the appearance of radiation in the Lamb shift
effect in the hydrogen atom and the dynamical Casimir effect. However, unlike
these effects, the radiation characteristics depend on the induction of
electric or magnetic fields. Moreover, in order to comply with the law of
conservation of momentum, the braking radiation of charged particles is
considered as the "third body". As opposed to this bremsstrahlung, radiation
from vacuum will not have a preferred direction. Analytical expressions
describing the radiation characteristics were obtained using a semi-classical
method. The calculated values of the energy and intensity of radiation from
vacuum demonstrate the possibility of using optical methods to determine the
characteristics of such radiation in strong electric or magnetic fields. The
results of the work can be used in studies of astrophysical objects with
powerful electric or magnetic fields, as well as in investigations of physical
vacuum states under laboratory conditions.

**Thermodynamic entropy production in the dynamical Casimir effect**—2023-09-14 (updated: 2023-11-16)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07847v2)]<br/>Gustavo de Oliveira, Lucas C. Céleri
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  This paper address the question of thermodynamic entropy production in the
context of the dynamical Casimir effect. Specifically, we study a scalar
quantum field confined within a one-dimensional ideal cavity subject to
time-varying boundary conditions dictated by an externally prescribed
trajectory of one of the cavity mirrors. The central question is how the
thermodynamic entropy of the field evolves over time. Utilizing an effective
Hamiltonian approach, we compute the entropy production and reveal that it
exhibits scaling behavior concerning the number of particles created in the
short-time limit. Furthermore, this approach elucidates the direct connection
between this entropy and the emergence of quantum coherence within the mode
basis of the field. In addition, by considering a distinct approach based on
the time evolution of Gaussian states we examine the long-time limit of entropy
production within a single mode of the field. This approach results in
establishing a connection between the thermodynamic entropy production in a
single field mode and the entanglement between that particular mode and all
other modes. Consequently, by employing two distinct approaches, we
comprehensively address both the short-term and long-term dynamics of the
system. Our results thus link the irreversible dynamics of the field, as
measured by entropy production and induced by the dynamical Casimir effect, to
two fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics: coherence and entanglement.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  This paper develops practical summation techniques in ZXW calculus to reason
about quantum dynamics, such as unitary time evolution. First we give a direct
representation of a wide class of sums of linear operators, including arbitrary
qubits Hamiltonians, in ZXW calculus. As an application, we demonstrate the
linearity of the Schroedinger equation and give a diagrammatic representation
of the Hamiltonian in Greene-Diniz et al, which is the first paper that models
carbon capture using quantum computing. We then use the Cayley-Hamilton theorem
to show in principle how to exponentiate arbitrary qubits Hamiltonians in ZXW
calculus. Finally, we develop practical techniques and show how to do Taylor
expansion and Trotterization diagrammatically for Hamiltonian simulation. This
sets up the framework for using ZXW calculus to the problems in quantum
chemistry and condensed matter physics.

**A $δ$-free approach to quantization of transmission lines connected to lumped circuits**—2023-11-16—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09897v1)]<br/>Carlo Forestiere, Giovanni Miano
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The quantization of systems composed of transmission lines connected to
lumped circuits poses significant challenges, arising from the interplay
between continuous and discrete degrees of freedom. A widely adopted strategy,
based on the pioneering work of Yurke and Denker, entails representing the
lumped circuit contributions using Lagrangian densities that incorporate Dirac
$\delta$-functions. However, this approach introduces complications, as
highlighted in the recent literature, including divergent momentum densities,
necessitating the use of regularization techniques. In this work, we introduce
a $\delta$-free Lagrangian formulation without the need for a discretization of
the transmission line or mode expansions. This is achieved by explicitly
enforcing boundary conditions at the line ends. In this framework, the
derivation of the Heisenberg equations of the network is straightforward. We
demonstrate that, in the Heisenberg representation a finite-length transmission
line can be described as a two-port system composed of two resistors and two
controlled sources with delay. This equivalent model extends the one-port model
which is commonly used in the literature for semi-infinite transmission lines.
Finally, we apply our approach to analytically solvable networks.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  A proper quantum memory is argued to consist in a quantum channel which
cannot be simulated with a measurement followed by classical information
storage and a final state preparation, i.e. an entanglement breaking (EB)
channel. The verification of quantum memories (non-EB channels) is a task in
which an honest user wants to test the quantum memory of an untrusted, remote
provider. This task is inherently suited for the class of protocols with
trusted quantum inputs, sometimes called measurement-device-independent (MDI)
protocols. Here, we study the MDI certification of non-EB channels in
continuous variable (CV) systems. We provide a simple witness based on
adversarial metrology, and describe an experimentally friendly protocol that
can be used to verify all non Gaussian incompatibility breaking quantum
memories. Our results can be tested with current technology and can be applied
to test other devices resulting in non-EB channels, such as CV quantum
transducers and transmission lines.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Polariton thermalization is a key process in achieving light-matter
Bose--Einstein condensation, spanning from solid-state semiconductor
microcavities at cryogenic temperatures to surface plasmon nanocavities with
molecules at room temperature. Originated from the matter component of
polariton states, the microscopic mechanisms of thermalization are closely tied
to specific material properties. In this work, we investigate polariton
thermalization in strongly-coupled molecular systems. We developed a
microscopic theory addressing polariton thermalization through electron-phonon
interactions (known as vibronic coupling) with low-energy molecular vibrations.
This theory presents a simple analytical method to calculate the
temperature-dependent polariton thermalization rate, utilizing experimentally
accessible spectral properties of bare molecules, such as the Stokes shift and
temperature-dependent linewidth of photoluminescence, in conjunction with
well-known parameters of optical cavities. Our findings demonstrate remarkable
agreement with recent experimental reports of nonequilibrium polariton
condensation in both ground and excited states, and explain the thermalization
bottleneck effect observed at low temperatures. This study showcases the
significance of vibrational degrees of freedom in polariton condensation and
offers practical guidance for future experiments, including the selection of
suitable material systems and cavity designs.

**Measurement Free Approach towards Dynamic Construction of a Shallow Depth Ansatz for Molecular Energetics in Noisy Quantum Computers**—2023-11-16—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09895v1)]<br/>Dipanjali Halder, Dibyendu Mondal, Rahul Maitra
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Recent advances in quantum information and quantum science have inspired the
development of various compact dynamic structured ansatze that are expected to
be realizable in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. However,
such ansatze construction strategies hitherto developed involve considerable
pre-circuit measurements, and thus they deviate significantly in NISQ platform
from their ideal structures. It is thus imperative that the usage of quantum
resources must be minimized while retaining the expressivity and dynamical
structure of the ansatz that can tailor itself depending on the degree of
strong correlation. We propose a novel ansatz construction strategy based on
the \textit{ab-initio} many-body perturbation theory that requires \textit{no}
pre-circuit measurement and thus it remains structurally unaffected by any
hardware noise. The accuracy and quantum complexity associated with the ansatz
are solely dictated by a pre-defined perturbative order as desired and hence
are tunable. Furthermore, the underlying perturbative structure of the ansatz
construction pipeline enables us to decompose any high-rank excitation that
appears in higher perturbative orders into various low-rank operators, and thus
keeps the execution gate-depth to its minimum. With a number of challenging
applications on strongly correlated system, we demonstrate that our ansatz
performs significantly better, both in terms of accuracy, parameter count and
circuit depth, in comparison to the allied unitary coupled cluster based
ansatze.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science
research. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and
it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical
internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed
globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over
long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize
quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in
order to understand how best to distribute entanglement, especially with the
limitations of near-term quantum technologies taken into account. This work
provides an initial step towards this goal. In this work, we lay out a theory
of near-term quantum networks based on Markov decision processes (MDPs), and we
show that MDPs provide a precise and systematic mathematical framework to model
protocols for near-term quantum networks that is agnostic to the specific
implementation platform. We start by simplifying the MDP for elementary links
introduced in prior work, and by providing new results on policies for
elementary links. In particular, we show that the well-known memory-cutoff
policy is optimal. Then we show how the elementary link MDP can be used to
analyze a quantum network protocol in which we wait for all elementary links to
be active before creating end-to-end links. We then provide an extension of the
MDP formalism to two elementary links, which is useful for analyzing more
sophisticated quantum network protocols. Here, as new results, we derive linear
programs that give us optimal steady-state policies with respect to the
expected fidelity and waiting time of the end-to-end link.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Noise is in general inevitable and detrimental to practical and useful
quantum communication and computation. Under the resource theory framework,
resource distillation serves as a generic tool to overcome the effect of noise.
Yet, conventional resource distillation protocols generally require operations
on multi-copies of resource states, and strong limitations exist that restrict
their practical utilities. Recently, by relaxing the setting of resource
distillation to only approximating the measurement statistics instead of the
quantum state, a resource-frugal protocol, virtual resource distillation, is
proposed, which allows more effective distillation of noisy resources. Here, we
report its experimental implementation on a four-qubit photonic quantum system
for the distillation of quantum coherence (up to dimension 4) and bipartite
entanglement. We show the virtual distillation of the maximal superposed state
of dimension four from the state of dimension two, an impossible task in
conventional coherence distillation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the virtual
distillation of entanglement with operations acting only on a single copy of
the noisy EPR pair and showcase the quantum teleportation task using the
virtually distilled EPR pair with a significantly improved fidelity of the
teleported state. These results illustrate the feasibility of the virtual
resource distillation method and pave the way for accurate manipulation of
quantum resources with noisy quantum hardware.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Multipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering admits multipartite
entanglement in the presence of uncharacterized verifiers, enabling practical
applications in semi-device-independent protocols. Such applications generally
require stronger steerability, while the unavoidable noise weakens steerability
and consequently degrades the performance of quantum information processing.
Here, we propose and demonstrate the optimal local filter operation to distill
genuine tripartite EPR steering from two copies of weakly steerable assemblages
in the context of two semi-device-independent cases -- one-sided
device-independent scenario and two-sided device-independent scenario -- on
three-qubit generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. The advance of the
optimal local filter is confirmed by the distilled assemblage in terms of
higher assemblage fidelity with perfectly genuine tripartite steerable
assemblages, as well as the greater violation of the inequality to witness
genuine tripartite steerable assemblages. Our results benefit the distillation
of multipartite EPR steering in practice, where the number of copies of initial
assemblages is generally finite.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) is a key distribution
scheme whose security is based on the laws of quantum physics but does not
require any assumptions about the devices used in the protocol. The security of
the existing entanglement-based DIQKD protocol relies on the Bell test. Here,
we propose an efficient device-independent quantum key distribution (EDIQKD)
protocol in which one participant prepares states and transmits them to another
participant through a quantum channel to measure. In this prepare-and-measure
protocol, the transmission process between participants is characterized
according to the process tomography for security, ruling out any mimicry using
the classical initial, transmission, and final state. When comparing the
minimum number of bits of the raw key, i.e., the key rounds, to guarantee
security against collective attacks, the efficiency of the EDIQKD protocol is
two orders of magnitude more than that of the DIQKD protocol for the reliable
key, the quantum bit error rate of which is allowed up to 6.5%. This advantage
will enable participants to substantially conserve the entangled pair's
demanded resources and the measurement. According to the highest detection
efficiency in the recent most advanced photonic experiment, our protocol can be
realized with a non-zero key rate and remains more efficient than usual DIQKD.
Our protocol and its security analysis may offer helpful insight into
identifying the typical prepare-and-measure quantum information tasks with the
device-independent scenario.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Entanglement is a fundamental concept at the core of quantum information
science, both in terms of its theoretical underpinnings and practical
applications. A key priority in studying and utilizing entanglement is to find
reliable procedures for the generation of entangled states. In this research,
we propose a graph-based method for systematically searching for schemes that
can produce genuine entanglement in arbitrary $N$-partite linear bosonic
systems, without postselection. While the entanglement generation without
postselection renders more tolerable schemes for quantum tasks, it is in
general more challenging to find appropriate circuits for systems with a large
number of parties. We present a practical strategy to mitigate the limitation
through the implementation of our graph technique. Our physical setup is based
on the sculpting protocol, which utilizes an $ N$ spatially overlapped
subtractions of single bosons to convert Fock states of evenly distributed
bosons into entanglement. We have identified general schemes for qubit
N-partite GHZ and W states, which are significantly more efficient than
previous schemes. In addition, our scheme for generating the superposition of
$N=3$ GHZ and W entangled states illustrates that our approach can be extended
to derive more generalized forms of entangled states. Furthermore, we have
found an N-partite GHZ state generation scheme for qudits, which requires
substantially fewer particles than previous proposals. These results
demonstrate the power of our approach in discovering clear solutions for the
generation of intricate entangled states. Our schemes can be directly
realizable in many-boson systems. As a proof of concept, we propose a linear
optical scheme for the generation of the Bell state by heralding detections.

  We study a 2D mesoscopic ring with an anisotropic effective mass considering
surface quantum confinement effects. Consider that the ring is defined on the
surface of a cone, which can be controlled topologically and mapped to the 2D
ring in flat space. We demonstrate through numerical analysis that the
electronic properties, the magnetization, and the persistent current undergo
significant changes due to quantum confinement and non-isotropic mass. We
investigate these changes in the direct band gap semiconductors SiC, ZnO, GaN,
and AlN. There is a plus (or minus) shift in the energy sub-bands for different
values of curvature parameter and anisotropy. Manifestations of this nature are
also seen in the Fermi energy profile as a function of the magnetic field and
in the ring width as a function of the curvature parameter. Aharonov-Bohm (AB)
and de Haas van-Alphen (dHvA) oscillations are also studied, and we find that
they are sensitive to variations in curvature and anisotropy.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The possibility of attaining chiral edge modes under periodic driving has
spurred tremendous attention, both theoretically and experimentally, especially
in light of anomalous Floquet topological phases that feature vanishing Chern
numbers unlike any static counterpart. We here consider a periodically
modulated honeycomb lattice and experimentally relevant driving protocols,
which allows us to obtain edge modes of various character in a simple model. We
calculate the phase diagram over a wide range of parameters and recover an
anomalous topological phase with quasienergy gaps harbouring edge states with
opposite chirality. Motivated by the advances in single-site control in optical
lattices, we investigate wave packet dynamics localized at the edges in
distinct Floquet topological regimes that cannot be achieved in equilibrium. We
analyse transport properties in edge modes originating from the same bands, but
with support at different quasienergies and sublattices as well as possessing
different chiralities. We find that an anomalous Floquet topological phase can
in general generate more robust chiral edge motion than a Haldane phase. Our
results demonstrate that the rich interplay of wave packet dynamics and
topological edge states can serve as a versatile tool in ultracold quantum
gases in optical lattices.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  With the explosion of data over the past decades there has been a respective
explosion of techniques to extract information from the data from labeled data,
quasi-labeled data, and data with no labels known a priori. For data with at
best quasi-labels, graphs are a natural structure to connect points to further
extract information. In particular, anomaly detection in graphs is a method to
determine which data points do not posses the latent characteristics of the
other data. There have been a variety of classical methods to score vertices on
their anomalous level with respect to the graph, spanning straightforward
methods of checking the local topology of a node to intricate neural networks.
Leveraging the structure of the graph, we propose a first ever quantum-based
technique to calculate the anomaly score of each node by continuously
traversing the graph in a particular manner. The proposed algorithm
incorporates well-known characteristics of quantum random walks, and an
adjustment to the algorithm is given to mitigate the increasing depth of the
circuit. This algorithm is rigorously shown to converge to the expected
probability, with respect to the initial condition.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  When a generic quantum system is prepared in a simple initial condition, it
typically equilibrates toward a state that can be described by a thermal
ensemble. A known exception are localized systems which are non-ergodic and do
not thermalize, however local observables are still believed to become
stationary. Here we demonstrate that this general picture is incomplete by
constructing product states which feature periodic high-fidelity revivals of
the full wavefunction and local observables that oscillate indefinitely. The
system neither equilibrates nor thermalizes. This is analogous to the
phenomenon of weak ergodicity breaking due to many-body scars and challenges
aspects of the current MBL phenomenology, such as the logarithmic growth of the
entanglement entropy. To support our claim, we combine analytic arguments with
large-scale tensor network numerics for the disordered Heisenberg chain. Our
results hold for arbitrarily long times in chains of 160 sites up to machine
precision.

**Encoding High-level Quantum Programs as SZX-diagrams**—2022-06-19 (updated: 2023-11-16)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09376v2)]<br/>Augustin Borgna, Rafael Romero

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The Scalable ZX-calculus is a compact graphical language used to reason about
linear maps between quantum states. These diagrams have multiple applications,
but they frequently have to be constructed in a case-by-case basis. In this
work we present a method to encode quantum programs implemented in a fragment
of the linear dependently typed Proto-Quipper-D language as families of
SZX-diagrams. We define a subset of translatable Proto-Quipper-D programs and
show that our procedure is able to encode non-trivial algorithms as diagrams
that grow linearly on the size of the program.

**A Compact TIA in 22nm FDSOI CMOS for Qubit Readout in Monolithic Quantum Processors**—2023-10-10 (updated: 2023-11-16)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06792v2)]<br/>Domenico Zito, Tan Doan Nhut
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  This paper reports an inductorless transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with very
compact size and adequate performance for spin qubit readout operations in
monolithic quantum processors. The TIA has been designed and fabricated in a
22nm FDSOI CMOS foundry technology commercially available. The measurement
results show a transimpedance gain of 103 dB{\Omega} with a bandwidth of 13
GHz, at room temperature, and it is expected to exhibit slightly superior
performance at cryogenic temperatures. The power consumption amounts to 4.1 mW.
The core area amount to 0.00025 mm2, i.e., about two orders of magnitude
smaller with respect to the prior-art works, and approaching the qubit size,
which makes the inductorless TIA a compact enabling solution for monolithic
quantum processors.

**Relaxation time as a control parameter for exploring dynamical phase diagrams**—2023-05-08 (updated: 2023-11-16)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04643v2)]<br/>Ángel L. Corps, Pedro Pérez-Fernández, Armando Relaño
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We explore a full dynamical phase diagram by means of a double quench
protocol that depends on a relaxation time as the only control parameter. The
protocol comprises two fixed quenches and an intermediate relaxation time that
determines the phase in which the quantum state is placed after the final
quench. We apply it to an anharmonic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. This model
displays two excited-state quantum phase transitions which split the spectrum
into three different phases: two of them are symmetry-breaking phases, and one
is a disordered phase. As a consequence, our protocol induces several kind of
dynamical phase transitions. We characterize all of them in terms of the
constants of motion characterizing all three phases of the model.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In the current era, known as Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ),
encoding large amounts of data in the quantum devices is challenging and the
impact of noise significantly affects the quality of the obtained results. A
viable approach for the execution of quantum classification algorithms is the
introduction of a well-known machine learning paradigm, namely, the ensemble
methods. Indeed, the ensembles combine multiple internal classifiers, which are
characterized by compact sizes due to the smaller data subsets used for
training, to achieve more accurate and robust prediction performance. In this
way, it is possible to reduce the qubits requirements with respect to a single
larger classifier while achieving comparable or improved performance. In this
work, we present an implementation and an extensive empirical evaluation of
ensembles of quantum classifiers for binary classification, with the purpose of
providing insights into their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for
enhancing the performance of basic quantum models. In particular, three
classical ensemble methods and three quantum classifiers have been taken into
account here. Hence, the scheme that has been implemented (in Python) has a
hybrid nature. The results (obtained on real-world datasets) have shown an
accuracy advantage for the ensemble techniques with respect to the single
quantum classifiers, and also an improvement in robustness. In fact, the
ensembles have turned out to be able to mitigate both unsuitable data
normalizations and repeated measurement inaccuracies, making quantum
classifiers more stable.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Based on the number operator on the half-line, we introduce a similarity
transformation of the Berry-Keating Hamiltonian, whose eigenfunctions vanish at
the Dirichlet boundary by the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. If the
Riemann hypothesis (RH) holds true, then its eigenvalues correspond to the
imaginary parts of the nontrivial zeros. Moreover, we explore the possibility
of whether the introduced Hamiltonian can serve as an approach to the RH within
the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture, which can be shown by proving the reality of
all the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. In an attempt to show the latter, we
identify the effective Hamiltonian in the Mellin space, where the Dirichlet
boundary condition manifests itself as an integral boundary condition. The
effective Hamiltonian can be transformed into the Berry-Keating Hamiltonian,
$\hat{H}_\text{BK}$, without altering the domain on which $\hat{H}_\text{BK}$
is self-adjoint. In essence, the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function
follow from the self-adjoint eigenvalue problem, $\hat{H}_\text{BK} \, h_s (z)
= \varepsilon_s \, h_s (z)$, subject to the integral boundary condition
$\int_0^\infty dz \, (1+ e^z)^{-1} h_s(z) = 0$.

**Scalable Imaginary Time Evolution with Neural Network Quantum States**—2023-07-28 (updated: 2023-11-16)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15521v4)]<br/>Eimantas Ledinauskas, Egidijus Anisimovas
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The representation of a quantum wave function as a neural network quantum
state (NQS) provides a powerful variational ansatz for finding the ground
states of many-body quantum systems. Nevertheless, due to the complex
variational landscape, traditional methods often employ the computation of
quantum geometric tensor, consequently complicating optimization techniques.
Contributing to efforts aiming to formulate alternative methods, we introduce
an approach that bypasses the computation of the metric tensor and instead
relies exclusively on first-order gradient descent with Euclidean metric. This
allows for the application of larger neural networks and the use of more
standard optimization methods from other machine learning domains. Our approach
leverages the principle of imaginary time evolution by constructing a target
wave function derived from the Schr\"odinger equation, and then training the
neural network to approximate this target. We make this method adaptive and
stable by determining the optimal time step and keeping the target fixed until
the energy of the NQS decreases. We demonstrate the benefits of our scheme via
numerical experiments with 2D J1-J2 Heisenberg model, which showcase enhanced
stability and energy accuracy in comparison to direct energy loss minimization.
Importantly, our approach displays competitiveness with the well-established
density matrix renormalization group method and NQS optimization with
stochastic reconfiguration.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Altering chemical reactivity and material structure in confined optical
environments is on the rise, and yet, a conclusive understanding of the
microscopic mechanisms remains elusive. This originates mostly from the fact
that accurately predicting vibrational and reactive dynamics for soluted
ensembles of realistic molecules is no small endeavor, and adding (collective)
strong light-matter interaction does not simplify matters. Here, we establish a
framework based on a combination of machine learning (ML) models, trained using
density-functional theory calculations, and molecular dynamics to accelerate
such simulations. We then apply this approach to evaluate strong coupling,
changes in reaction rate constant, and their influence on enthalpy and entropy
for the deprotection reaction of 1-phenyl-2-trimethylsilylacetylene, which has
been studied previously both experimentally and using ab initio simulations.
While we find qualitative agreement with critical experimental observations,
especially with regard to the changes in kinetics, we also find differences in
comparison with previous theoretical predictions. The features for which the
ML-accelerated and ab initio simulations agree show the experimentally
estimated kinetic behavior. Conflicting features indicate that a contribution
of electronic polarization to the reaction process is more relevant then
currently believed. Our work demonstrates the practical use of ML for
polaritonic chemistry, discusses limitations of common approximations and paves
the way for a more holistic description of polaritonic chemistry.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The traditional view from particle physics is that quantum gravity effects
should only become detectable at extremely high energies and small length
scales. Due to the significant technological challenges involved, there has
been limited progress in identifying experimentally detectable effects that can
be accessed in the foreseeable future. However, in recent decades, the size and
mass of quantum systems that can be controlled in the laboratory have reached
unprecedented scales, enabled by advances in ground-state cooling and
quantum-control techniques. Preparations of massive systems in quantum states
paves the way for the explorations of a low-energy regime in which gravity can
be both sourced and probed by quantum systems. Such approaches constitute an
increasingly viable alternative to accelerator-based, laser-interferometric,
torsion-balance, and cosmological tests of gravity. In this review, we provide
an overview of proposals where massive quantum systems act as interfaces
between quantum mechanics and gravity. We discuss conceptual difficulties in
the theoretical description of quantum systems in the presence of gravity,
review tools for modeling massive quantum systems in the laboratory, and
provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art experimental landscape.
Proposals covered in this review include, among others, precision tests of
gravity, tests of gravitationally-induced wavefunction collapse and
decoherence, as well as gravity-mediated entanglement. We conclude the review
with an outlook and discussion of future questions.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum annealers are suited to solve several logistic optimization problems
expressed in the QUBO formulation. However, the solutions proposed by the
quantum annealers are generally not optimal, as thermal noise and other
disturbing effects arise when the number of qubits involved in the calculation
is too large. In order to deal with this issue, we propose the use of the
classical branch-and-bound algorithm, that divides the problem into
sub-problems which are described by a lower number of qubits. We analyze the
performance of this method on two problems, the knapsack problem and the
traveling salesman problem. Our results show the advantages of this method,
that balances the number of steps that the algorithm has to make with the
amount of error in the solution found by the quantum hardware that the user is
willing to risk. All the results are actual runs on the quantum annealer D-Wave
Advantage.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Control over the joint spectral amplitude of a photon pair has proved highly
desirable for many quantum applications, since it contains the spectral quantum
correlations, and has crucial effects on the indistinguishability of photons,
as well as promising emerging applications involving complex quantum functions
and frequency encoding of qudits. Until today, this has been achieved by
engineering a single degree of freedom, either by custom poling nonlinear
crystal or by shaping the pump pulse. We present a combined approach where two
degrees of freedom, the phase-matching function, and the pump spectrum, are
controlled. This approach enables the two-dimensional control of the joint
spectral amplitude, generating a variety of spectrally encoded quantum states -
including frequency uncorrelated states, frequency-bin Bell states, and
biphoton qudit states. In addition, the joint spectral amplitude is controlled
by photon bunching and anti-bunching, reflecting the symmetry of the
phase-matching function.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Flexible Job Shop Scheduling (FJSSP) is a complex optimization problem
crucial for real-world process scheduling in manufacturing. Efficiently solving
such problems is vital for maintaining competitiveness. This paper introduces
Quantum Annealing-based solving algorithm (QASA) to address FJSSP, utilizing
quantum annealing and classical techniques. QASA optimizes multi-criterial
FJSSP considering makespan, total workload, and job priority concurrently. It
employs Hamiltonian formulation with Lagrange parameters to integrate
constraints and objectives, allowing objective prioritization through weight
assignment. To manage computational complexity, large instances are decomposed
into subproblems, and a decision logic based on bottleneck factors is used.
Experiments on benchmark problems show QASA, combining tabu search, simulated
annealing, and Quantum Annealing, outperforms a classical solving algorithm
(CSA) in solution quality (set coverage and hypervolume ratio metrics).
Computational efficiency analysis indicates QASA achieves superior Pareto
solutions with a reasonable increase in computation time compared to CSA.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm
designed for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. It is promising
for quantum chemical calculations (QCC) because it can calculate the
ground-state energy of a target molecule. Although VQE has a potential to
achieve a higher accuracy than classical approximation methods in QCC, it is
challenging to achieve it on current NISQ computers due to the significant
impact of noises. Density matrix embedding theory (DMET) is a well-known
technique to divide a molecule into multiple fragments, which is available to
mitigate the noise impact on VQE. However, our preliminary evaluation shows
that the naive combination of DMET and VQE does not outperform a gold standard
classical method.
  In this work, we present three approaches to mitigate the noise impact for
the DMET+VQE combination. (1) The size of quantum circuits used by VQE is
decreased by reducing the number of bath orbitals which represent interactions
between multiple fragments in DMET. (2) Reduced density matrices (RDMs), which
are used to calculate a molecular energy in DMET, are calculated accurately
based on expectation values obtained by executing quantum circuits using a
noise-less quantum computer simulator. (3) The parameters of a quantum circuit
optimized by VQE are refined with mathematical post-processing. The evaluation
using a noisy quantum computer simulator shows that our approaches
significantly improve the accuracy of the DMET+VQE combination. Moreover, we
demonstrate that on a real NISQ device, the DMET+VQE combination applying our
three approaches achieves a higher accuracy than the gold standard classical
method.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In this work the root to macroscopic quantum effects is revealed based on the
quasiparticle model of collective excitations in an arbitrary degenerate
electron gas. The $N$-electron quantum system is considered as $N$ streams
coupled, through the Poisson's relation, which are localized in momentum space
rather than electron localization in real space, assumed in ordinary many body
theories. Using a new wavefunction representation, the $N+1$-coupled system is
reduced to simple pseudoforce equations via quasiparticle (collective quantum)
model leading to a generalized matter wave dispersion relation. It is shown
that the resulting dual lengthscale de Broglie's matter wave theory predicts
macroscopic quantum effects and deterministic field trajectories for charges
moving in the electron gas due to the coupling of the electrostatic field to
the local electron number density. It is remarked that any quantum many body
system composed of large number of interacting particles acts as a dual arm
device controlling the microscopic single particle effects with one hand and
the macroscopic phenomena with the other. Current analysis can be further
extended to include the magnetic potential and spin exchange effects. Present
model can also be used to confirm macroscopic entanglement of charged particles
embedded in a quantum electron fluid.

**Evolution Operator Can Always be Separated into the Product of Holonomy and Dynamic Operators**—2023-11-16—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09597v1)]<br/>Xiao-Dong Yu, D. M. Tong
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The geometric phase is a fundamental quantity characterizing the holonomic
feature of quantum systems. It is well known that the evolution operator of a
quantum system undergoing a cyclic evolution can be simply written as the
product of holonomic and dynamical components for the three special cases
concerning the Berry phase, adiabatic non-Abelian geometric phase, and
nonadiabatic Abelian geometric phase. However, for the most general case
concerning the nonadiabatic non-Abelian geometric phase, how to separate the
evolution operator into holonomic and dynamical components is a long-standing
open problem. In this work, we solve this open problem. We show that the
evolution operator of a quantum system can always be separated into the product
of holonomy and dynamic operators. Based on it, we further derive a matrix
representation of this separation formula for cyclic evolution, and give a
necessary and sufficient condition for a general evolution being purely
holonomic. Our finding is not only of theoretical interest itself, but also of
vital importance for the application of quantum holonomy. It unifies the
representations of all four types of evolution concerning the
adiabatic/nonadiabatic Abelian/non-Abelian geometric phase, and provides a
general approach to realizing purely holonomic evolution.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We explore the dynamics of quantum spin systems in two and three dimensions
using an exact mapping to classical stochastic processes. In recent work we
explored the effectiveness of sampling around the mean field evolution as
determined by a stochastically averaged Weiss field. Here, we show that this
approach can be significantly extended by sampling around the instantaneous
Weiss field associated with each stochastic trajectory taken separately. This
trajectory-resolved approach incorporates sample to sample fluctuations and
allows for longer simulation times. We demonstrate the utility of this approach
for quenches in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional quantum Ising model.
We show that the method is particularly advantageous in situations where the
average Weiss-field vanishes, but the trajectory-resolved Weiss fields are
non-zero. We discuss the connection to the gauge-P phase space approach, where
the trajectory-resolved Weiss field can be interpreted as a gauge degree of
freedom.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Today's mechanical sensors are capable of detecting extremely weak
perturbations while operating near the standard quantum limit. However, further
improvements can be made in both sensitivity and bandwidth when we reduce the
noise originating from the process of measurement itself -- the
quantum-mechanical backaction of measurement -- and go below this 'standard'
limit, possibly approaching the Heisenberg limit. One of the ways to eliminate
this noise is by measuring a quantum nondemolition variable such as the
momentum in a free-particle system. Here, we propose and characterize
theoretical models for direct velocity measurement that utilize traditional
electric and magnetic transducer designs to generate a signal while enabling
this backaction evasion. We consider the general readout of this signal via
electric or magnetic field sensing by creating toy models analogous to the
standard optomechanical position-sensing problem, thereby facilitating the
assessment of measurement-added noise. Using simple models that characterize a
wide range of transducers, we find that the choice of readout scheme -- voltage
or current -- for each mechanical detector configuration implies access to
either the position or velocity of the mechanical sub-system. This in turn
suggests a path forward for key fundamental physics experiments such as the
direct detection of dark matter particles.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We introduce a meta logarithmic-Sobolev (log-Sobolev) inequality for the
Lindbladian of all single-mode phase-covariant Gaussian channels of bosonic
quantum systems, and prove that this inequality is saturated by thermal states.
We show that our inequality provides a general framework to derive information
theoretic results regarding phase-covariant Gaussian channels. Specifically, by
using the optimality of thermal states, we explicitly compute the optimal
constant $\alpha_p$, for $1\leq p\leq 2$, of the $p$-log-Sobolev inequality
associated to the quantum Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. These constants were
previously known for $p=1$ only. Our meta log-Sobolev inequality also enables
us to provide an alternative proof for the constrained minimum output entropy
conjecture in the single-mode case. Specifically, we show that for any
single-mode phase-covariant Gaussian channel $\Phi$, the minimum of the von
Neumann entropy $S\big(\Phi(\rho)\big)$ over all single-mode states $\rho$ with
a given lower bound on $S(\rho)$, is achieved at a thermal state.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Coherently dressed spins have shown promising results as building blocks for
future quantum computers owing to their resilience to environmental noise and
their compatibility with global control fields. This mode of operation allows
for more amenable qubit architecture requirements and simplifies signal routing
on the chip. However, multi-qubit operations, such as qubit addressability and
two-qubit gates, are yet to be demonstrated to establish global control in
combination with dressed qubits as a viable path to universal quantum
computing. Here we demonstrate simultaneous on-resonance driving of degenerate
qubits using a global field while retaining addressability for qubits with
equal Larmor frequencies. Furthermore, we implement SWAP oscillations during
on-resonance driving, constituting the demonstration of driven two-qubit gates.
Significantly, our findings highlight the fragility of entangling gates between
superposition states and how dressing can increase the noise robustness. These
results represent a crucial milestone towards global control operation with
dressed qubits. It also opens a door to interesting spin physics on degenerate
spins.

  The accurate description and robust computational modeling of the
nonequilibrium properties of quantum systems remain challenges in condensed
matter physics. In this work, we develop a linear-scale computational
simulation technique for the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum quench
systems. In particular, we report a polynomial expansion of the Loschmidt echo
to describe the dynamical quantum phase transitions of noninteracting quantum
quench systems. An expansion based method allows us to efficiently compute the
Loschmidt echo for infinitely large systems without diagonalizing the system
Hamiltonian. To demonstrate its utility, we highlight quantum quenching
dynamics under tight-binding quasicrystals and disordered lattices in one
spatial dimension. In addition, the role of the wave vector on the quench
dynamics under lattice models is addressed. We observe wave vector-independent
dynamical phase transitions in self-dual localization models.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We investigate the properties of the fermionic Fulling-Rindler vacuum for a
massive Dirac field in a general number of spatial dimensions. As important
local characteristics, the fermionic condensate and the expectation value of
the energy-momentum tensor are evaluated. The renormalization is reduced to the
subtraction of the corresponding expectation values for the Minkowski vacuum.
It is shown that the fermion condensate vanishes for a massless field and is
negative for nonzero mass. Unlike the case of scalar fields, the fermionic
vacuum stresses are isotropic for general case of massive fields. The energy
density and the pressures are negative. For a massless field the corresponding
spectral distributions exhibit thermal properties with the standard Unruh
temperature. However, the density-of-states factor is not Planckian for general
number of spatial dimensions. Another interesting feature is that the thermal
distribution is of the Bose-Einstein type in even number of spatial dimensions.
This feature has been observed previously in the response of a particle
detector uniformly accelerating through the Minkowski vacuum. In an even number
of space dimensions the fermion condensate and the mean energy-momentum tensor
coincide for the fields realizing two inequivalent irreducible representations
of the Clifford algebra. In the massless case, we consider also the vacuum
energy-momentum tensor for Dirac fields in the conformal vacuum of the Milne
universe, in static open universe and in the hyperbolic vacuum of de Sitter
spacetime.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We study low-energy scattering of spin-1/2 baryons from the perspective of
quantum information science, focusing on the correlation between entanglement
minimization and the appearance of accidental symmetries. The baryon transforms
as an octet under the SU(3) flavor symmetry and its interactions below the pion
threshold are described by contact operators in an effective field theory (EFT)
of QCD. Despite there being 64 channels in the 2-to-2 scattering, only six
independent operators in the EFT are predicted by SU(3). We show that
successive entanglement minimization in SU(3)-symmetric channels are correlated
with increasingly large emergent symmetries in the EFT. In particular, we
identify scattering channels whose entanglement suppression are indicative of
emergent SU(6), SO(8), SU(8), and SU(16) symmetries. We also observe the
appearance of non-relativistic conformal invariance in channels with
unnaturally large scattering lengths. Improved precision from lattice
simulations could help determine the degree of entanglement suppression, and
consequently the amount of accidental symmetry, in low-energy QCD.

we call succinct RSPV for classical functions (SRC). Suppose $f$ is a function
described by a polynomial time classical Turing machine, which is public; the
client would like to sample a random $x$ as the function input and use a
protocol to send $f(x)$ to the server. What's more, (1) when the server is
malicious, what it knows in the passing space should be no more than $f(x)$;
(2) the communication should be succinct (that is, independent to the running
time of evaluating $f$). Solving this problem in classical cryptography seems
to require strong cryptographic assumptions.
  We show that, perhaps surprisingly, it's possible to solve this problem with
quantum techniques under much weaker assumptions. By allowing for quantum
communication and computations, we give a protocol for this problem assuming
only collapsing hash functions [Unr16]. Our work conveys an interesting message
that quantum cryptography could outperform classical cryptography in a new type
of problems, that is, to reduce communications in meaningful primitives without
using heavy classical cryptographic assumptions.

**NLTS Hamiltonians and Strongly-Explicit SoS Lower Bounds from Low-Rate Quantum LDPC Codes**—2023-11-16—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09503v1)]<br/>Louis Golowich, Tali Kaufman
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Recent constructions of the first asymptotically good quantum LDPC (qLDPC)
codes led to two breakthroughs in complexity theory: the NLTS (No Low-Energy
Trivial States) theorem (Anshu, Breuckmann, and Nirkhe, STOC'23), and explicit
lower bounds against a linear number of levels of the Sum-of-Squares (SoS)
hierarchy (Hopkins and Lin, FOCS'22).
  In this work, we obtain improvements to both of these results using qLDPC
codes of low rate:
  - Whereas Anshu et al. only obtained NLTS Hamiltonians from qLDPC codes of
linear dimension, we show the stronger result that qLDPC codes of arbitrarily
small positive dimension yield NLTS Hamiltonians.
  - The SoS lower bounds of Hopkins and Lin are only weakly explicit because
they require running Gaussian elimination to find a nontrivial codeword, which
takes polynomial time. We resolve this shortcoming by introducing a new method
of planting a strongly explicit nontrivial codeword in linear-distance qLDPC
codes, which in turn yields strongly explicit SoS lower bounds.
  Our "planted" qLDPC codes may be of independent interest, as they provide a
new way of ensuring a qLDPC code has positive dimension without resorting to
parity check counting, and therefore provide more flexibility in the code
construction.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We propose two optimal phase-estimation schemes that can be used for
quantum-enhanced long-baseline interferometry. By using distributed
entanglement, it is possible to eliminate the loss of stellar photons during
transmission over the baselines. The first protocol is a sequence of gates
using nonlinear optical elements, optimized over all possible measurement
schemes to saturate the Cram\'er-Rao bound. The second approach builds on an
existing protocol, which encodes the time of arrival of the stellar photon into
a quantum memory. Our modified version reduces both the number of ancilla
qubits and the number of gate operations by a factor of two.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  A robust combiner combines many candidates for a cryptographic primitive and
generates a new candidate for the same primitive. Its correctness and security
hold as long as one of the original candidates satisfies correctness and
security. A universal construction is a closely related notion to a robust
combiner. A universal construction for a primitive is an explicit construction
of the primitive that is correct and secure as long as the primitive exists. It
is known that a universal construction for a primitive can be constructed from
a robust combiner for the primitive in many cases.
  Although robust combiners and universal constructions for classical
cryptography are widely studied, robust combiners and universal constructions
for quantum cryptography have not been explored so far. In this work, we define
robust combiners and universal constructions for several quantum cryptographic
primitives including one-way state generators, public-key quantum money,
quantum bit commitments, and unclonable encryption, and provide constructions
of them.
  On a different note, it was an open problem how to expand the plaintext
length of unclonable encryption. In one of our universal constructions for
unclonable encryption, we can expand the plaintext length, which resolves the
open problem.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The cooperative modification of spontaneous radiative decay is a paradigmatic
many-emitter effect in quantum optics. So far its experimental realization has
involved interactions mediated by rapidly escaping photons that do not play an
active role in the emitter dynamics. Here we explore cooperative dynamics of
quantum emitters in an optical lattice that interact by radiating atomic matter
waves. Using the ability to prepare weakly and strongly interacting many-body
phases of excitations in an array of matter-wave emitters, we demonstrate
directional super- and subradiance from a superfluid phase with tunable
radiative phase lags, and directly access the buildup of coherence imprinted by
the emitted radiation across a Mott insulator. We investigate the onset of
cooperative dynamics for slow wave propagation and observe a coupling to
collective bound states with radiation trapped at and between the emitters. Our
results in open-system quantum electrodynamics establish ultracold matter waves
as a versatile tool for studying many-body quantum optics in spatially extended
and ordered systems.

**A Unifying View of Fermionic Neural Network Quantum States: From Neural Network Backflow to Hidden Fermion Determinant States**—2023-11-15—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09450v1)]<br/>Zejun Liu, Bryan K. Clark
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Among the variational wave functions for Fermionic Hamiltonians, neural
network backflow (NNBF) and hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) are two
prominent classes to provide accurate approximations to the ground state. Here
we develop a unifying view of fermionic neural quantum states casting them all
in the framework of NNBF. NNBF wave-functions have configuration-dependent
single-particle orbitals (SPO) which are parameterized by a neural network. We
show that HFDS with $r$ hidden fermions can be written as a NNBF with an $r
\times r$ determinant Jastrow and a restricted low-rank $r$ additive correction
to the SPO. Furthermore, we show that in NNBF wave-functions, such determinant
Jastrow's can generically be removed at the cost of further complicating the
additive SPO correction increasing its rank by $r$. We numerically and
analytically compare additive SPO corrections generated by the product of two
matrices with inner dimension $r$. We find that larger $r$ wave-functions span
a larger space and give evidence that simpler and more direct updates to the
SPO's tend to be more expressive and better energetically. These suggest the
standard NNBF approach is preferred amongst other related choices. Finally, we
uncover that the row-selection used to select single-particle orbitals allows
significant sign and amplitude modulation between nearby configurations and is
partially responsible for the quality of NNBF and HFDS wave-functions.

  Experimental quantum physics and computing platforms rely on sophisticated

the sequence used to create a Bose-Einstein condensate at the University of
Illinois, which involves 46,812 analog and digital transitions over 100 seconds

of performance. The system uses a master 10 MHz reference clock that is
conditioned to the Global Positioning Satellite constellation and leverages
low-phase-noise clock distribution hardware for timing stability. A
Python-based user front-end provides a flexible language to describe
experimental procedures and easy-to-implement version control. A library of

**Photonic quantum computing on thin-film lithium niobate: Part I Design of an efficient heralded single photon source co-integrated with superconducting detectors**—2023-11-15—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09398v1)]<br/>A. Sayem
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Photonic quantum computers are currently one of the primary candidates for
fault-tolerant quantum computation. At the heart of the photonic quantum
computation lies the strict requirement for suitable quantum sources e.g. high
purity, high brightness single photon sources. To build a practical quantum
computer, thousands to millions of such sources are required. In this article,
we theoretically propose a unique single-photon source design on a thin-film
lithium niobate (TFLN) platform co-integrated with superconducting nanowire
single-photon detectors. We show that with a judicial design of single photon
source using thin film periodically poled lithium waveguides (PPLN),
back-illuminated grating couplers (GCs) and directly bonded or integrated
cavity coupled superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) can
lead to a simple but practical high efficiency heralded single-photon source
using the current fabrication technology. Such a device will eliminate the
requirement of out coupling of the generated photons and can lead to a fully
integrated solution. The proposed design can be useful for fusion-based quantum
computation and for multiplexed single photon sources and also for efficient
on-chip generation and detection of squeezed light.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  High-fidelity preparation of quantum states in an interacting many-body
system is often hindered by the lack of knowledge of such states and by limited
decoherence times. Here we study a quantum optimal control (QOC) approach for
fast generation of quantum ground states in a finite-sized Jaynes-Cummings
lattice with unit filling. Our result shows that the QOC approach can generate
quantum many-body states with high fidelity when the evolution time is above a
threshold time, and it can significantly outperform the adiabatic approach. We
study the dependence of the threshold time on the parameter constraints and the
connection of the threshold time with the quantum speed limit. We also show
that the QOC approach can be robust against control errors. Our result can lead
to advances in the application of the QOC for many-body state preparation.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Two-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures form the
foundation of numerous nanoscale physical systems. However, measuring the
properties of such heterostructures, and characterizing the semiconductor
in-situ is challenging. A recent experimental study [arXiv:2107.03695] was able
to probe the semiconductor within the heterostructure using microwave
measurements of the superfluid density. This work revealed a rapid depletion of
superfluid density in semiconductor, caused by the in-plane magnetic field
which in presence of spin-orbit coupling creates so-called Bogoliubov Fermi
surfaces. The experimental work used a simplified theoretical model that
neglected the presence of non-magnetic disorder in the semiconductor, hence
describing the data only qualitatively. Motivated by experiments, we introduce
a theoretical model describing a disordered semiconductor with strong
spin-orbit coupling that is proximitized by a superconductor. Our model
provides specific predictions for the density of states and superfluid density.
Presence of disorder leads to the emergence of a gapless superconducting phase,
that may be viewed as a manifestation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface. When applied
to real experimental data, our model showcases excellent quantitative
agreement, enabling the extraction of material parameters such as mean free
path and mobility, and estimating $g$-tensor after taking into account the
orbital contribution of magnetic field. Our model can be used to probe in-situ
parameters of other superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures and can be
further extended to give access to transport properties.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Distant quantum control via quantum gates represents an essential step toward
realizing distributed quantum networks. An efficient theoretical protocol for
the dual non-local implementation of controlled-not (CNOT) gates between two
separated partners is presented in this regard. The suggested protocol requires
1~ebit with local operations and classical communication channels. The
efficiency of the teleportation scheme is quantified through an infidelity
measure. The numerical results show that the infidelity of performing the CNOT
gate between legitimate partners depends on the initial qubit settings. It is
also shown that the protocol is performed efficiently if the CNOT control qubit
and the auxiliary qubit are prepared in the same direction. Furthermore, we
provide a noise analysis for the suggested scheme. We find that by maintaining
the noise strengths under the threshold $\frac{1}{4}$, one can achieve the dual
non-local CNOT gate optimally.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Understanding thermodynamical measurement noise is of central importance for
electrical and optical precision measurements from mass-fabricated
semiconductor sensors, where the Brownian motion of charge carriers poses
limits, to optical reference cavities for atomic clocks or gravitational wave
detection, which are limited by thermorefractive and thermoelastic noise due to
the transduction of temperature fluctuations to the refractive index and length
fluctuations. Here, we discover that unexpectedly charge carrier density
fluctuations give rise to a novel noise process in recently emerged
electro-optic photonic integrated circuits. We show that Lithium Niobate and
Lithium Tantalate photonic integrated microresonators exhibit an unexpected
Flicker type (i.e. $1/f^{1.2}$) scaling in their noise properties,
significantly deviating from the well-established thermorefractive noise
theory. We show that this noise is consistent with thermodynamical charge
noise, which leads to electrical field fluctuations that are transduced via the
strong Pockels effects of electro-optic materials. Our results establish
electrical Johnson-Nyquist noise as the fundamental limitation for Pockels
integrated photonics, crucial for determining performance limits for both
classical and quantum devices, ranging from ultra-fast tunable and low-noise
lasers, Pockels soliton microcombs, to quantum transduction, squeezed light or
entangled photon-pair generation. Equally, this observation offers optical
methods to probe mesoscopic charge fluctuations with exceptional precision.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  This work is divided into two parts. The first examines recent proposals for
"witnessing" quantum gravity via entanglement from the point of view of
Bronstein's original objection to a quantization of gravity. Using techniques
from open quantum systems we sketch how unavoidable decoherence from both
inertial and gravitational backreaction between probe and detector could spoil
the experimental detection of the quantization of gravity. We argue that this
"failure" is actually an inherent feature of any quantum description that
attempts to incorporate the equivalence principle exactly within quantum
dynamics. In the second part, we speculate on how an exact realization of the
equivalence principle might be implemented in an effective quantum field theory
via the general covariance of correlators. While we are far from giving an
explicit construction of such a theory we point out some features and
consequences of such a program.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Accurate modeling of noise in realistic quantum processors is critical for
constructing fault-tolerant quantum computers. While a full simulation of
actual noisy quantum circuits provides information about correlated noise among
all qubits and is therefore accurate, it is, however, computationally expensive
as it requires resources that grow exponentially with the number of qubits. In
this paper, we propose an efficient systematic construction of approximate
noise channels, where their accuracy can be enhanced by incorporating noise
components with higher qubit-qubit correlation degree. To formulate such
approximate channels, we first present a method, dubbed the cluster expansion
approach, to decompose the Lindbladian generator of an actual Markovian noise
channel into components based on interqubit correlation degree. We then
generate a $k$-th order approximate noise channel by truncating the cluster
expansion and incorporating noise components with correlations up to the $k$-th
degree. We require that the approximate noise channels must be accurate and
also "honest", i.e., the actual errors are not underestimated in our physical
models. As an example application, we apply our method to model noise in a
three-qubit quantum processor that stabilizes a [[2,0,0]] codeword, which is
one of the four Bell states. We find that, for realistic noise strength typical
for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits coupled via always-on static
interactions, correlated noise beyond two-qubit correlation can significantly
affect the code simulation accuracy. Since our approach provides a systematic
noise characterization, it enables the potential for accurate, honest and
scalable approximation to simulate large numbers of qubits from full modeling
or experimental characterizations of small enough quantum subsystems, which are
efficient but still retain essential noise features of the entire device.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Chirality, or handedness, is a geometrical property denoting a lack of mirror
symmetry. Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and is associated with the
non-reciprocal interactions observed in complex systems ranging from
biomolecules to topological materials. Here, we demonstrate that chiral
arrangements of dipole-coupled atoms or molecules can facilitate the
unidirectional transport of helical photonic excitations without breaking
time-reversal symmetry. We show that such helicity dependent transport stems
from an emergent spin-orbit coupling induced by the chiral geometry, which
results in nontrivial topological properties. We also examine the effects of
collective dissipation and find that many-body coherences lead to helicity
dependent photon emission: an effect we call helical superradiance. Our results
demonstrate an intimate connection between chirality, topology, and photon
helicity that may contribute to molecular photodynamics in nature and could be
probed with near-term quantum simulators.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Spin-orbit coupled dynamics are of fundamental interest in both quantum
optical and condensed matter systems alike. In this work, we show that photonic
excitations in pseudospin-1/2 atomic lattices exhibit an emergent spin-orbit
coupling when the geometry is chiral. This spin-orbit coupling arises naturally
from the electric dipole interaction between the lattice sites and leads to
spin polarized excitation transport. Using a general quantum optical model, we
determine analytically the conditions that give rise to spin-orbit coupling and
characterize the behavior under various symmetry transformations. We show that
chirality-induced spin textures are associated with a topologically nontrivial
Zak phase that characterizes the chiral setup. Our results demonstrate that
chiral atom arrays are a robust platform for realizing spin-orbit coupled
topological states of matter.

reconstruction attempts. We apply these considerations to a variety of

on real hardware. We also study how noise impacts these calculations and
discuss noise mitigation required to extend our work to larger quantum

  The decoherence of a central electron spin due to the dynamics of a coupled

show the coherent back-action of an individual NV center on an electron-spin

that underlie the central spin decoherence and provides new opportunities for

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Shadow tomography aims to build a classical description of a quantum state
from a sequence of simple random measurements. Physical observables are then
reconstructed from the resulting classical shadow. Shadow protocols which use
single-body random measurements are simple to implement and capture few-body
observables efficiently, but do not apply to systems with fundamental number
conservation laws, such as ultracold atoms. We address this shortcoming by
proposing and analyzing a new local shadow protocol adapted to such systems.
The "All-Pairs" protocol requires one layer of two-body gates and only
$\textrm{poly}(V)$ samples to reconstruct arbitrary few body observables.
Moreover, by exploiting the permutation symmetry of the protocol, we derive a
linear time post-processing algorithm. We provide a proof-of-principle
reference implementation and demonstrate the reconstruction of 2- and 4-point
functions in a paired Luttinger liquid of hardcore bosons.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum chaotic systems are characterized by energy correlations in their
spectral statistics, usually probed by the distribution of nearest-neighbor
level spacings. Some signatures of chaos, like the spectral form factor (SFF),
take all the correlations into account, while others sample only short-range or
long-range correlations. Here, we characterize correlations between
eigenenergies at all possible spectral distances. Specifically, we study the
distribution of $k$-th neighbor level spacings ($k$nLS) and compute its
associated $k$-th neighbor spectral form factor ($k$nSFF). This leads to two
new full-range signatures of quantum chaos, the variance of the $k$nLS
distribution and the minimum value of the $k$nSFF, which quantitatively
characterize correlations between pairs of eigenenergies with any number of
levels $k$ between them. We find exact and approximate expressions for these
signatures in the three Gaussian ensembles of random matrix theory (GOE, GUE
and GSE) and in integrable systems with completely uncorrelated spectra (the
Poisson ensemble). We illustrate our findings in a XXZ spin chain with
disorder, which interpolates between chaotic and integrable behavior. Our
refined measures of chaos allow us to probe deviations from Poissonian and
Random Matrix behavior in realistic systems. This illustrates how the measures
we introduce bring a new light into studying many-body quantum systems, which
lie in-between the fully chaotic or fully integrable models.

**Polaronic mechanism of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in Hubbard models**—2023-11-15—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09279v1)]<br/>Rhine Samajdar, R. N. Bhatt

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The search for elusive Nagaoka-type ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model has
recently enjoyed renewed attention with the advent of a variety of experimental
platforms enabling its realization, including moir\'e materials, quantum dots,
and ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Here, we demonstrate a universal
mechanism for Nagaoka ferromagnetism (that applies to both bipartite and
nonbipartite lattices) based on the formation of ferromagnetic polarons
consisting of a dopant dressed with polarized spins. Using large-scale
density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we present a comprehensive
study of the ferromagnetic polaron in an electron-doped Hubbard model,

Moreover, we systematically probe the internal structure of the magnetic

spin-charge-spin correlation functions$\unicode{x2014}$for both the
single-polaron limit and the high-density regime of interacting polarons. Our
results highlight the crucial role of mobile polarons in the birth of global
ferromagnetic order from local ferromagnetism and provide a unified framework
to understand the development and demise of the Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic
state across dopings.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Preparing ground states and thermal states is essential for simulating
quantum systems on quantum computers. Despite the hope for practical quantum
advantage in quantum simulation, popular state preparation approaches have been
challenged. Monte Carlo-style quantum Gibbs samplers have emerged as an
alternative, but prior proposals have been unsatisfactory due to technical
obstacles rooted in energy-time uncertainty. We introduce simple
continuous-time quantum Gibbs samplers that overcome these obstacles by
efficiently simulating Nature-inspired quantum master equations (Lindbladians).
In addition, we construct the first provably accurate and efficient algorithm
for preparing certain purified Gibbs states (called thermal field double states
in high-energy physics) of rapidly thermalizing systems; this algorithm also
benefits from a quantum walk speedup. Our algorithms' costs have a provable
dependence on temperature, accuracy, and the mixing time (or spectral gap) of
the relevant Lindbladian. We complete the first rigorous proof of finite-time
thermalization for physically derived Lindbladians by developing a general
analytic framework for nonasymptotic secular approximation and approximate
detailed balance. Given the success of classical Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithms and the ubiquity of thermodynamics, we anticipate that
quantum Gibbs sampling will become indispensable in quantum computing.

  We provide a universal construction of the category of finite-dimensional
C*-algebras and completely positive trace-nonincreasing maps from the rig
category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and unitaries. This construction,
which can be applied to any dagger rig category, is described in three steps,
each associated with their own universal property, and draws on results from
dilation theory in finite dimension. In this way, we explicitly construct the
category that captures hybrid quantum/classical computation with possible
nontermination from the category of its reversible foundations. We discuss how
this construction can be used in the design and semantics of quantum
programming languages.

**An efficient and exact noncommutative quantum Gibbs sampler**—2023-11-15—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09207v1)]<br/>Chi-Fang Chen, Michael J. Kastoryano, András Gilyén
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Preparing thermal and ground states is an essential quantum algorithmic task
for quantum simulation. In this work, we construct the first efficiently
implementable and exactly detailed-balanced Lindbladian for Gibbs states of
arbitrary noncommutative Hamiltonians. Our construction can also be regarded as
a continuous-time quantum analog of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. To
prepare the quantum Gibbs state, our algorithm invokes Hamiltonian simulation
for a time proportional to the mixing time and the inverse temperature $\beta$,
up to polylogarithmic factors. Moreover, the gate complexity reduces
significantly for lattice Hamiltonians as the corresponding Lindblad operators
are (quasi-) local (with radius $\sim\beta$) and only depend on local
Hamiltonian patches. Meanwhile, purifying our Lindbladians yields a
temperature-dependent family of frustration-free "parent Hamiltonians",
prescribing an adiabatic path for the canonical purified Gibbs state (i.e., the
Thermal Field Double state). These favorable features suggest that our
construction is the ideal quantum algorithmic counterpart of classical Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampling.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Frustration in magnetic materials arising from competing exchange
interactions can prevent the system from adopting long-range magnetic order and
can instead lead to a diverse range of novel quantum and topological states
with exotic quasiparticle excitations. Here, we review prominent examples of
such emergent phenomena, including magnetically-disordered and extensively
degenerate spin ices, which feature emergent magnetic monopole excitations,
highly-entangled quantum spin liquids with fractional spinon excitations,
topological order and emergent gauge fields, as well as complex particle-like
topological spin textures known as skyrmions. We provide an overview of recent
advances in the search for magnetically-disordered candidate materials on the
three-dimensional pyrochlore lattice and two-dimensional triangular, kagome and
honeycomb lattices, the latter with bond-dependent Kitaev interactions, and on
lattices supporting topological magnetism. We highlight experimental signatures
of these often elusive phenomena and single out the most suitable experimental
techniques that can be used to detect them. Our review also aims at providing a
comprehensive guide for designing and investigating novel frustrated magnetic
materials, with the potential of addressing some important open questions in
contemporary condensed matter physics.

**Optimizing Fictitious States for Bell Inequality Violation in Bipartite Qubit Systems**—2023-11-15—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09166v1)]<br/>Kun Cheng, Tao Han, Matthew Low
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  There is a significant interest in testing quantum entanglement and Bell
inequality violation in high-energy experiments. Since the analyses in
high-energy experiments are performed with events statistically averaged over
phase space, the states used to determine observables depend on the choice of
coordinates through an event-dependent basis and are thus not genuine quantum
states, but rather "fictitious states." We prove that if Bell inequality
violation is observed with a fictitious state, then it implies the same for a
quantum sub-state. We further show analytically that the basis which
diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for constructing fictitious
states, and for maximizing the violation of Bell's inequality.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We introduce an explicit construction for a key distribution protocol in the
Quantum Computational Timelock (QCT) security model, where one assumes that
computationally secure encryption may only be broken after a time much longer
than the coherence time of available quantum memories.
  Taking advantage of the QCT assumptions, we build a key distribution protocol
called HM-QCT from the Hidden Matching problem for which there exists an
exponential gap in one-way communication complexity between classical and
quantum strategies.
  We establish that the security of HM-QCT against arbitrary i.i.d. attacks can
be reduced to the difficulty of solving the underlying Hidden Matching problem
with classical information. Legitimate users, on the other hand, can use
quantum communication, which gives them the possibility of sending multiple
copies of the same quantum state while retaining an information advantage. This
leads to an everlasting secure key distribution scheme over $n$ bosonic modes.
Such a level of security is unattainable with purely classical techniques.
Remarkably, the scheme remains secure with up to $\mathcal{O}\big(
\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log(n)}\big)$ input photons for each channel use, extending
the functionalities and potentially outperforming QKD rates by several orders
of magnitudes.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The theory of entropic gravity conjectures that gravity emerges
thermodynamically rather than being a fundamental force. One of the main
criticisms of entropic gravity is that it would lead to quantum massive
particles losing coherence in free fall, which is not observed experimentally.
This criticism was refuted in [Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 033065 (2021)], where a
nonrelativistic master equation modeling gravity as an open quantum system
interaction demonstrated that in the strong coupling limit, coherence could be
maintained and reproduce conventional free-fall dynamics. Moreover, the
nonrelativistic master equation was shown to be fully compatible with the
qBounce experiment for ultracold neutrons. Motivated by this, we extend these
results to gravitationally accelerating Dirac fermions. We achieve this by
using the Dirac equation in Rindler space and modeling entropic gravity as a
thermal bath thus adopting the open quantum systems approach as well. We
demonstrate that in the strong coupling limit, our entropic gravity model
maintains quantum coherence for Dirac fermions. In addition, we demonstrate
that spin is not affected by entropic gravity. We use the Foldy-Wouthysen
transformation to demonstrate that it reduces to the nonrelativistic master
equation, supporting the entropic gravity hypothesis for Dirac fermions. Also,
we demonstrate how antigravity seemingly arises from the Dirac equation for
free-falling antiparticles but use numerical simulations to show that this
phenomenon originates from zitterbewegung thus not violating the equivalence
principle.

**Quest for optimal quantum resetting protocols**—2023-11-15—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09150v1)]<br/>Pallabi Chatterjee, S. Aravinda, Ranjan Modak
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In the classical context, it is well known that, sometimes, if the search
does not find its target, it is better to start the process anew again, known
as resetting. The quantum counterpart of resetting also indicates speeding up
the detection process by eliminating the dark states, i.e., situations where
the particle avoids detection. In this work, we introduce a most probable
position resetting (MPR) protocol in which we reset the particle in a position
where the probability of finding the particle could have been maximum, provided
one would let the system evolve unitarily in a given time window. In a
tight-binding lattice model, there exists a 2-fold degeneracy (left and right)
of the positions of maximum probability. The survival probability with optimal
restart rate approaches zero (detection probability approaches one) when the
particle is reset with equal probability on both sides. This protocol
significantly reduces the optimal mean first-detected-passage time (FDT) and
performs better even if the detector is far apart compared to the usual
resetting protocols where the particle is brought back to the initial position.
We propose a modified protocol, adaptive MPR, by making the associated
probabilities of resetting to the right and left a function of resetting steps.
In this protocol, we see a further reduction of the optimal mean FDT and
improvement in the search process when the detector is far apart.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Topological and symmetry-protected non-Hermitian zero modes have attracted
considerable interest in the past few years. Here we reveal that they can
exhibit an unusual behavior when transitioning between the extended and
localized regimes: When weakly coupled to a non-Hermitian reservoir, such a
zero mode displays a linearly decreasing amplitude as a function of space,
which is not caused by an EP of a Hamiltonian, either of the entire system or
the reservoir itself. Instead, we attribute it to the non-Bloch solution of a
linear homogeneous recurrence relation, together with the underlying
non-Hermitian particle-hole symmetry and the zeroness of its energy.

**Entanglement Routing over Networks with Time Multiplexed Repeaters**—2023-08-29 (updated: 2023-11-15)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15028v2)]<br/>Emily A Van Milligen, Eliana Jacobson, Ashlesha Patil, Gayane Vardoyan, Don Towsley, Saikat Guha
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum networks will be able to service consumers with long distance
entanglement by use of repeater nodes that can both generate external Bell
pairs with their neighbors, iid with probability $p$, as well as perform
internal Bell State Measurements (BSMs) which succeed with some probability
$q$. The actual values of these probabilities is dependent upon the
experimental parameters of the network in question. While global link state
knowledge is needed to maximize the rate of entanglement generation between any
two consumers, this may be an unreasonable request due to the dynamic nature of
the network. This work evaluates a local link state knowledge, multi-path
routing protocol that works with time multiplexed repeaters that are able to
perform BSMs across different time steps. This study shows that the average
rate increases with the time multiplexing block length, $k$, although the
initial latency also increases. When a step function memory decoherence model
is introduced so that qubits are held in the quantum memory for a time
exponentially distributed with mean $\mu$, an optimal $k$ ($k_\text{opt}$)
value appears. As $p$ decreases or $\mu$ increases the value of $k_\text{opt}$
increases. This value is such that the benefits from time multiplexing are
balanced with the increased risk of losing a previously established entangled
pair.

**Efficient sampling of noisy shallow circuits via monitored unraveling**—2023-06-28 (updated: 2023-11-15)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16455v2)]<br/>Zihan Cheng, Matteo Ippoliti
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We introduce a classical algorithm for sampling the output of shallow, noisy
random circuits on two-dimensional qubit arrays. The algorithm builds on the
recently-proposed "space-evolving block decimation" (SEBD) and extends it to
the case of noisy circuits. SEBD is based on a mapping of 2D unitary circuits
to 1D {\it monitored} ones, which feature measurements alongside unitary gates;
it exploits the presence of a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition
to achieve efficient (approximate) sampling below a finite critical depth
$T_c$. Our noisy-SEBD algorithm unravels the action of noise into measurements,
further lowering entanglement and enabling efficient classical sampling up to
larger circuit depths. We analyze a class of physically-relevant noise models
(unital qubit channels) within a two-replica statistical mechanics treatment,
finding weak measurements to be the optimal (i.e. most disentangling)
unraveling. We then locate the noisy-SEBD complexity transition as a function
of circuit depth and noise strength in realistic circuit models. As an
illustrative example, we show that circuits on heavy-hexagon qubit arrays with
noise rates of $\approx 2\%$ per CNOT, based on IBM Quantum processors, can be
efficiently sampled up to a depth of 5 iSWAP (or 10 CNOT) gate layers. Our
results help sharpen the requirements for practical hardness of simulation of
noisy hardware.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We show the applicability of the Cartan decomposition of Lie algebras to
quantum circuits. This approach can be used to synthesize circuits that can
efficiently implement any desired unitary operation. Our method finds explicit
quantum circuit representations of the algebraic generators of the relevant Lie
algebras allowing the direct implementation of a Cartan decomposition on a
quantum computer. The construction is recursive and allows us to expand any
circuit down to generators and rotation matrices on individual qubits, where
through our recursive algorithm we find that the generators themselves can be
expressed with controlled-not (CNOT) and SWAP gates explicitly. Our approach is
independent of the standard CNOT implementation and can be easily adapted to
other cross-qubit circuit elements. In addition to its versatility, we also
achieve near-optimal counts when working with CNOT gates, achieving an
asymptotic cnot cost of $\frac{21}{16}4^n$ for $n$ qubits.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Beginning with the Everett-DeWitt many-worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics, there have been a series of proposals for how the state vector of a
quantum system might split at any instant into orthogonal branches, each of
which exhibits approximately classical behavior. In an earlier version of the
present work, we proposed a decomposition of a state vector into branches by
finding the minimum of a measure of the mean squared quantum complexity of the
branches in the branch decomposition. In the present article, we adapt the
earlier version to quantum electrodynamics of electrons and protons on a
lattice in Minkowski space. The earlier version, however, here is simplified by
replacing a definition of complexity based on the physical vacuum with a
definition based on the bare vacuum. As a consequence of this replacement, the
physical vacuum itself is expected to branch yielding branches with energy
densities slightly larger than that of the unbranched vacuum but no observable
particle content. If the vacuum energy renormalization constant is chosen as
usual to give 0 energy density to the unbranched vacuum, vacuum branches will
appear to have a combination of dark energy and dark matter densities. The
hypothesis that vacuum branching is the origin of the observed dark energy and
dark matter densities leads to an estimate of $O(10^{-18} m^3)$ for the
parameter $b$ which enters the complexity measure governing branch formation
and sets the boundary between quantum and classical behavior.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Repeated measurements can induce entanglement phase transitions in the
dynamics of quantum systems. Interacting models, both chaotic and integrable,
generically show a stable volume-law entangled phase at low measurement rates
which disappears for free, Gaussian fermions. Interactions break the
Gaussianity of a dynamical map in its unitary part, but non-Gaussianity can be
introduced through measurements as well. By comparing the entanglement and
non-Gaussianity structure of different protocols, we propose a new
single-particle indicator of the measurement-induced phase transition and we
use it to argue in favour of the stability of the transition when
non-Gaussianity is purely provided by measurements

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We describe a quantum algorithm for finding the smallest eigenvalue of a
Hermitian matrix. This algorithm combines Quantum Phase Estimation and Quantum
Amplitude Estimation to achieve a quadratic speedup with respect to the best
classical algorithm in terms of matrix dimensionality, i.e.,
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{N}/\epsilon)$ black-box queries to an oracle
encoding the matrix, where $N$ is the matrix dimension and $\epsilon$ is the
desired precision. In contrast, the best classical algorithm for the same task
requires $\Omega(N)\text{polylog}(1/\epsilon)$ queries. In addition, this
algorithm allows the user to select any constant success probability. We also
provide a similar algorithm with the same runtime that allows us to prepare a
quantum state lying mostly in the matrix's low-energy subspace. We implement
simulations of both algorithms and demonstrate their application to problems in
quantum chemistry and materials science.

**Analysis of sum-of-squares relaxations for the quantum rotor model**—2023-11-15—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09010v1)]<br/>Sujit Rao
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The noncommutative sum-of-squares (ncSoS) hierarchy was introduced by
Navascu\'{e}s-Pironio-Ac\'{i}n as a sequence of semidefinite programming
relaxations for approximating values of noncommutative polynomial optimization
problems, which were originally intended to generalize quantum values of
nonlocal games. Recent work has started to analyze the hierarchy for
approximating ground energies of local Hamiltonians, initially through rounding
algorithms which output product states for degree-2 ncSoS applied to Quantum
Max-Cut. Some rounding methods are known which output entangled states, but
they use degree-4 ncSoS. Based on this, Hwang-Neeman-Parekh-Thompson-Wright
conjectured that degree-2 ncSoS cannot beat product state approximations for
Quantum Max-Cut and gave a partial proof relying on a conjectural
generalization of Borrell's inequality. In this work we consider a family of
Hamiltonians (called the quantum rotor model in condensed matter literature or
lattice $O(k)$ vector model in quantum field theory) with infinite-dimensional
local Hilbert space $L^{2}(S^{k - 1})$, and show that a degree-2 ncSoS
relaxation approximates the ground state energy better than any product state.

successful run results on Fraunhofer Q System One in Ehningen will be presented

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Choosing an optimal time step $\delta t$ is crucial for an efficient
Hamiltonian simulation based on Trotterization but difficult due to the complex
structure of the Trotter error. Here we develop a method measuring the Trotter
error by combining the second- and fourth-order Trotterizations rather than
consulting with mathematical error bounds. Implementing this method, we
construct an algorithm, which we name Trotter24, for adaptively using almost
the largest stepsize $\delta t$, which keeps quantum circuits shallowest,
within an error tolerance $\epsilon$ preset for our purpose. Trotter24 applies
to generic Hamiltonians, including time-dependent ones, and can be generalized
to any orders of Trotterization. Benchmarking it in a quantum spin chain, we
find the adaptively chosen $\delta t$ to be about ten times larger than that
inferred from known upper bounds of Trotter errors. Trotter24 allows us to keep
the quantum circuit thus shallower within the error tolerance in exchange for
paying the cost of measurements.

  Standard cavity cooling of atoms or dielectric particles is based on the
action of dispersive optical forces in high-finesse cavities. We investigate
here a complementary regime characterized by large cavity losses, resembling
the standard Doppler cooling technique. For a single two-level emitter a
modification of the cooling rate is obtained from the Purcell enhancement of
spontaneous emission in the large cooperativity limit. This mechanism is aimed
at cooling of quantum emitters without closed transitions, which is the case
for molecular systems, where the Purcell effect can mitigate the loss of
population from the cooling cycle. We extend our analytical formulation to the
many particle case governed by weak individual coupling but exhibiting
collective strong Purcell enhancement to a cavity mode.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  As qubit-based platforms face near-term technical challenges in terms of
scalability, qudits, $d$-level quantum bases of information, are being
implemented in multiple platforms as an alternative for Quantum Information
Processing (QIP). It is, therefore, crucial to study their efficiencies for QIP
compared to more traditional qubit platforms, specifically since each
additional quantum level represents an additional source of environmental
coupling. We present a comparative study of the infidelity scalings of a qudit
and $n$-qubit systems, both with identical Hilbert space dimensions and noisy
environments. The first-order response of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) to
the noise in the Lindblad formalism, which was found to be gate-independent,
was calculated analytically in the two systems being compared. This yielded a
critical curve $(d^2-1)/3\log_2(d)$ of the ratio of their respective figure of
merits, defined as the gate time in units of decoherence time. This quantity
indicates how time-efficient operations on these systems are relative to
decoherence timescales, and the critical curve is especially useful for
precisely benchmarking qudit platforms with smaller values of $d$. The curve
delineates regions where each system has a higher rate of increase of the AGI
than the other. This condition on gate efficiency was applied to different
existing platforms. Specific qudit platforms were found to possess gate
efficiencies competitive with state-of-the-art qubit platforms. Numerical
simulations complemented this work and allowed for discussion of the
applicability and limits of the linear response formalism.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Non-Hermitian quasicrystal constitutes a unique class of disordered open
system with PT-symmetry breaking, localization and topological triple phase
transitions. In this work, we uncover the effect of quantum correlation on
phase transitions and entanglement dynamics in non-Hermitian quasicrystals.
Focusing on two interacting bosons in a Bose-Hubbard lattice with
quasiperiodically modulated gain and loss, we find that the onsite interaction
between bosons could drag the PT and localization transition thresholds towards
weaker disorder regions compared with the noninteracting case. Moreover, the
interaction facilitates the expansion of the critical point of a triple phase
transition in the noninteracting system into a critical phase with mobility
edges, whose domain could be flexibly controlled by tuning the interaction
strength. Systematic analyses of the spectrum, inverse participation ratio,
topological winding number, wavepacket dynamics and entanglement entropy lead
to consistent predictions about the correlation-driven phases and transitions
in our system. Our findings pave the way for further studies of the interplay
between disorder and interaction in non-Hermitian quantum matter.

  A universal framework for quantum-classical dynamics based on
information-theoretic approaches is presented. Based on this, we analyze the
interaction between quantum matter and a classical gravitational field. We
point out that, under the assumption of conservation of momentum or energy, the
classical gravitational field cannot cause the change of the momentum or energy
of the quantum system, which is not consistent with the observation of existing
experiments (e.g. the free fall experiment), while on the contrary the quantum
gravitational field can do so. Our analysis exposes the fundamental
relationship between conservation laws and the quantum properties of objects,
offering new perspectives for the study of quantum gravity.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum algorithms are getting extremely popular due to their potential to
significantly outperform classical algorithms. Yet, applying quantum algorithms
to optimization problems meets challenges related to the efficiency of quantum
algorithms training, the shape of their cost landscape, the accuracy of their
output, and their ability to scale to large-size problems. Here, we present an
approximate gradient-based quantum algorithm for hardware-efficient circuits
with amplitude encoding. We show how simple linear constraints can be directly
incorporated into the circuit without additional modification of the objective
function with penalty terms. We employ numerical simulations to test it on
MaxCut problems with complete weighted graphs with thousands of nodes and run
the algorithm on a superconducting quantum processor. We find that for
unconstrained MaxCut problems with more than 1000 nodes, the hybrid approach
combining our algorithm with a classical solver called CPLEX can find a better
solution than CPLEX alone. This demonstrates that hybrid optimization is one of
the leading use cases for modern quantum devices.

**Stochastic behavior of outcome of Schur-Weyl duality measurement**—2021-04-26 (updated: 2023-11-15)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12635v2)]<br/>Masahito Hayashi, Akihito Hora, Shintarou Yanagida
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We focus on the measurement defined by the decomposition based on Schur-Weyl
duality on $n$ qubits. As the first setting, we discuss the asymptotic behavior
of the measurement outcome when the state is given as the permutation mixture
$\rho_{mix,n,l}$ of the state $| 1^{l} \, 0^{n-l} \rangle := | 1
\rangle^{\otimes l} \otimes |0\rangle^{\otimes (n-l)}$. In contrast, when the
state is given as the Dicke state $|\Xi_{n,l}\rangle$, the measurement outcome
takes one deterministic value. These two cases have completely different
behaviors. As the second setting, we study the case when the state is given as
the tensor product of the permutation mixture $\rho_{mix,k,l}$ and the Dicke
state $| \Xi_{n-k,m-l} \rangle$. We derive various types of asymptotic
distribution including a kind of central limit theorem when $n$ goes to
infinity.

**Variational manifolds for ground states and scarred dynamics of blockade-constrained spin models on two and three dimensional lattices**—2023-11-15—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08965v1)]<br/>Joey Li, Giuliano Giudici, Hannes Pichler
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We introduce a variational manifold of simple tensor network states for the
study of a family of constrained models that describe spin-1/2 systems as
realized by Rydberg atom arrays. Our manifold permits analytical calculation
via perturbative expansion of one- and two-point functions in arbitrary spatial
dimensions and allows for efficient computation of the matrix elements required
for variational energy minimization and variational time evolution in up to
three dimensions. We apply this framework to the PXP model on the hypercubic
lattice in 1D, 2D, and 3D, and show that, in each case, it exhibits quantum
phase transitions breaking the sub-lattice symmetry in equilibrium, and hosts
quantum many body scars out of equilibrium. We demonstrate that our variational
ansatz qualitatively captures all these phenomena and predicts key quantities
with an accuracy that increases with the dimensionality of the lattice, and
conclude that our method can be interpreted as a generalization of mean-field
theory to constrained spin models.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) enables the extraction of high-quality results
from the presently-available noisy quantum computers. In this approach, the
effect of the noise on observables of interest can be mitigated using multiple
measurements without additional hardware overhead. Unfortunately, current QEM
techniques are limited to weak noise or lack scalability. In this work, we
introduce a QEM method termed `Adaptive KIK' that adapts to the noise level of
the target device, and therefore, can handle moderate-to-strong noise. The
implementation of the method is experimentally simple -- it does not involve
any tomographic information or machine-learning stage, and the number of
different quantum circuits to be implemented is independent of the size of the
system. Furthermore, we have shown that it can be successfully integrated with
randomized compiling for handling both incoherent as well as coherent noise.
Our method handles spatially correlated and time-dependent noise which enables
to run shots over the scale of days or more despite the fact that noise and
calibrations change in time. Finally, we discuss and demonstrate why our
results suggest that gate calibration protocols should be revised when using
QEM. We demonstrate our findings in the IBM quantum computers and through
numerical simulations.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The study of noise assisted transport in quantum systems is essential in a
wide range of applications from near-term NISQ devices to models for quantum
biology. Here, we study a generalised XXZ model in the presence of stochastic
collision noise, which allows to describe environments beyond the standard
Markovian formulation. Our analysis through the study of the local
magnetization, the inverse participation ratio (IPR) or its generalisation, the
Inverse Ergodicity Ratio (IER), showed clear regimes where the transport rate
and coherence time can be controlled by the dissipation in a consistent manner.
In addition, when considering several excitations, we characterize the
interplay between collisions and system interactions identifying regimes in
which transport is counterintuitively enhanced when increasing the collision
rate, even in the case of initially separated excitations. These results
constitute an example of the essential building blocks for the understanding of
quantum transport in structured noisy and warm disordered environments.

**Coherence as an indicator to discern electromagnetically induced transparency and Autler-Townes splitting**—2023-09-05 (updated: 2023-11-15)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02321v2)]<br/>Arif Warsi Laskar, Pratik Adhikary, Niharika Singh, Saikat Ghosh
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and Autler-Townes splitting
(ATS) are generally characterized and distinguished by the width of the
transparency created in the absorption profile of a weak probe in presence of a
strong control field. This often leads to ambiguities, as both phenomena yield
similar spectroscopic signature. However, an objective method based on Akaike's
Information Criterion (AIC) test offers a quantitative way to discern the two
regimes when applied on the probe absorption profile. The obtained transition
value of control field strength was found to be higher than the value given by
pole analysis of the corresponding off-diagonal density matrix element. By
contrast, we apply the test on ground state coherence and the measured
coherence quantifier, which yields a distinct transition point around the
predicted value even in presence of noise. Our test accurately captures the
transition between two regimes, indicating that a proper measure of coherence
is essential for making such distinctions.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Continuous time crystals (CTCs) are characterized by sustained oscillations
that break the time translation symmetry. Since the ruling out of equilibrium
CTCs by no-go theorems, the emergence of such dynamical phases has been
observed in various driven-dissipative quantum platforms. The current
understanding of CTCs is mainly based on mean-field (MF) theories, which fail
to address the problem of whether the long-range time crystalline order exists
in noisy, spatially extended systems without the protection of all-to-all
couplings. Here, we propose a new kind of CTC realized in a quantum contact
model through self-organized bistability (SOB). The exotic CTCs stem from the
interplay between collective dissipation induced by the first-order absorbing
phase transitions (APTs) and slow constant driving provided by an incoherent
pump. The stability of such oscillatory phases in finite dimensions under the
action of intrinsic quantum fluctuations is scrutinized by the functional
renormalization group method and numerical simulations. Occurring at the edge
of quantum synchronization, the CTC phase exhibits an inherent period and
amplitude with a coherence time diverging with system size, thus also
constituting a boundary time crystal (BTC). Our results serve as a solid route
towards self-protected CTCs in strongly interacting open systems.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Thin-film nanostructures with embedded M\"ossbauer nuclei have been
successfully used for x-ray quantum optical applications with hard x-rays
coupling in grazing incidence. Here we address theoretically a new geometry, in
which hard x-rays are coupled in forward incidence (front coupling), setting
the stage for waveguide QED with nuclear x-ray resonances. We develop a general
model based on the Green's function formalism of the field-nucleus interaction
in one dimensional waveguides, and show that it combines aspects of both
nuclear forward scattering, visible as dynamical beating in the spatio-temporal
response, and the resonance structure from grazing incidence, visible in the
spectrum of guided modes. The interference of multiple modes is shown to play
an important role, resulting in beats with wavelengths on the order of tens of
microns, on the scale of practical photolithography. This allows for the design
of special sample geometries to explore the resonant response or micro-striped
waveguides, opening a new toolbox of geometrical design for hard X-ray quantum
optics.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  De Finetti theorems tell us that if we expect the likelihood of outcomes to
be independent of their order, then these sequences of outcomes could be
equivalently generated by drawing an experiment at random from a distribution,
and repeating it over and over. In particular, the quantum de Finetti theorem
says that exchangeable sequences of quantum states are always represented by
distributions over a single state produced over and over. The main result of
this paper is that this quantum de Finetti construction has a universal
property as a categorical limit. This allows us to pass canonically between
categorical treatments of finite dimensional quantum theory and the infinite
dimensional. The treatment here is through understanding properties of
(co)limits with respect to the contravariant functor which takes a C*-algebra
describing a physical system to its convex, compact space of states, and
through discussion of the Radon probability monad. We also show that the same
categorical analysis also justifies a continuous de Finetti theorem for
classical probability.

**Dynamic Qubit Routing with CNOT Circuit Synthesis for Quantum Compilation**—2022-05-02 (updated: 2023-11-15)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00724v4)]<br/>Arianne Meijer-van de Griend, Sarah Meng Li
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Many quantum computers have constraints regarding which two-qubit operations
are locally allowed. To run a quantum circuit under those constraints, qubits
need to be mapped to different quantum registers, and multi-qubit gates need to
be routed accordingly. Recent developments have shown that compiling strategies
based on the Steiner tree provide a competitive tool to route CNOTs. However,
these algorithms require the qubit map to be decided before routing. Moreover,
the qubit map is fixed throughout the computation, i.e. the logical qubit will
not be moved to a different physical qubit register. This is inefficient with
respect to the CNOT count of the resulting circuit.
  In this paper, we propose the algorithm PermRowCol for routing CNOTs in a
quantum circuit. It dynamically remaps logical qubits during the computation,
and thus results in fewer output CNOTs than the algorithms Steiner-Gauss and
RowCol.
  Here we focus on circuits over CNOT only, but this method could be
generalized to a routing and mapping strategy on Clifford+T circuits by slicing
the quantum circuit into subcircuits composed of CNOTs and single-qubit gates.
Additionally, PermRowCol can be used in place of Steiner-Gauss in the synthesis
of phase polynomials as well as the extraction of quantum circuits from ZX
diagrams.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Path sums are a convenient symbolic formalism for quantum operations with
applications to the simulation, optimization, and verification of quantum
protocols. Unlike quantum circuits, path sums are not limited to unitary
operations, but can express arbitrary linear ones. Two problems, therefore,
naturally arise in the study of path sums: the unitarity problem and the
extraction problem. The former is the problem of deciding whether a given path
sum represents a unitary operator. The latter is the problem of constructing a
quantum circuit, given a path sum promised to represent a unitary operator.
  In this paper, we show that the unitarity problem is co-NP-hard in general,
but that it is in P when restricted to Clifford path sums. We then provide an
algorithm to synthesize a Clifford circuit from a unitary Clifford path sum.
The circuits produced by our extraction algorithm are of the form C1-H-C2,
where C1 and C2 are Hadamard-free circuits and H is a layer of Hadamard gates.
We also provide a heuristic generalization of our extraction algorithm to
arbitrary path sums. While this algorithm is not guaranteed to succeed, it
often succeeds and typically produces natural looking circuits. Alongside
applications to the optimization and decompilation of quantum circuits, we
demonstrate the capability of our algorithm by synthesizing the standard
quantum Fourier transform directly from a path sum.

  In this paper, we investigate the performances of tunable quantum neural
networks in the Quantum Probably Approximately Correct (QPAC) learning
framework. Tunable neural networks are quantum circuits made of
multi-controlled X gates. By tuning the set of controls these circuits are able
to approximate any Boolean functions. This architecture is particularly suited
to be used in the QPAC-learning framework as it can handle the superposition
produced by the oracle. In order to tune the network so that it can approximate
a target concept, we have devised and implemented an algorithm based on
amplitude amplification. The numerical results show that this approach can
efficiently learn concepts from a simple class.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Ambiguity is a natural language phenomenon occurring at different levels of
syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. It is widely studied; in Psycholinguistics,
for instance, we have a variety of competing studies for the human
disambiguation processes. These studies are empirical and based on eye-tracking
measurements. Here we take first steps towards formalizing these processes for
semantic ambiguities where we identified the presence of two features: (1)
joint plausibility degrees of different possible interpretations, (2) causal
structures according to which certain words play a more substantial role in the
processes. The novel sheaf-theoretic model of definite causality developed by
Gogioso and Pinzani in QPL 2021 offers tools to model and reason about these
features. We applied this theory to a dataset of ambiguous phrases extracted
from Psycholinguistics literature and their human plausibility judgements
collected by us using the Amazon Mechanical Turk engine. We measured the causal
fractions of different disambiguation orders within the phrases and discovered
two prominent orders: from subject to verb in the subject-verb and from object
to verb in the verb object phrases. We also found evidence for delay in the
disambiguation of polysemous vs homonymous verbs, again compatible with
Psycholinguistic findings.

$\lambda$-Q#'s type system and present its equational semantics based on a

**Identification of Causal Influences in Quantum Processes**—2023-11-15—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08882v1)]<br/>Isaac Friend, Aleks Kissinger
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Though the topic of causal inference is typically considered in the context
of classical statistical models, recent years have seen great interest in
extending causal inference techniques to quantum and generalized theories.
Causal identification is a type of causal inference problem concerned with
recovering from observational data and qualitative assumptions the causal
mechanisms generating the data, and hence the effects of hypothetical
interventions. A major obstacle to a theory of causal identification in the
quantum setting is the question of what should play the role of "observational
data," as any means of extracting data at a certain locus will almost certainly
disturb the system. Hence, one might think a priori that quantum measurements
are already too much like interventions, so that the problem of causal
identification trivializes. This is not the case. Fixing a limited class of
quantum instruments (namely the class of all projective measurements) to play
the role of "observations," we note that as in the classical setting, there
exist scenarios for which causal identification is not possible. We then
present sufficient conditions for quantum causal identification, starting with
a quantum analogue of the well-known "front-door criterion" and finishing with
a broader class of scenarios for which the effect of a single intervention is
identifiable. These results emerge from generalizing the process-theoretic
account of classical causal inference due to Jacobs, Kissinger, and Zanasi
beyond the setting of Markov categories, and thereby treating the classical and
quantum problems uniformly.

**Complete Flow-Preserving Rewrite Rules for MBQC Patterns with Pauli Measurements**—2022-05-04 (updated: 2023-11-15)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02009v5)]<br/>Tommy McElvanney, Miriam Backens
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In the one-way model of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC),
computation proceeds via measurements on some standard resource state.
So-called flow conditions ensure that the overall computation is deterministic
in a suitable sense, with Pauli flow being the most general of these. Existing
work on rewriting MBQC patterns while preserving the existence of flow has
focused on rewrites that reduce the number of qubits.
  In this work, we show that introducing new Z-measured qubits, connected to
any subset of the existing qubits, preserves the existence of Pauli flow.
Furthermore, we give a unique canonical form for stabilizer ZX-diagrams
inspired by recent work of Hu & Khesin. We prove that any MBQC-like stabilizer
ZX-diagram with Pauli flow can be rewritten into this canonical form using only
rules which preserve the existence of Pauli flow, and that each of these rules
can be reversed while also preserving the existence of Pauli flow. Hence we
have complete graphical rewriting for MBQC-like stabilizer ZX-diagrams with
Pauli flow.

**Logical Characterization of Contextual Hidden-Variable Theories based on Quantum Set Theory**—2023-11-15—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09268v1)]<br/>Masanao Ozawa
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  While non-contextual hidden-variable theories are proved to be impossible,
contextual ones are possible. In a contextual hidden-variable theory, an
observable is called a beable if the hidden-variable assigns its value in a
given measurement context specified by a state and a preferred observable.
Halvorson and Clifton characterized the algebraic structure of beables as a von
Neumann subalgebra, called a beable subalgebra, of the full observable algebra
such that the probability distribution of every observable affiliated therewith
admits the ignorance interpretation. On the other hand, we have shown that for
every von Neumann algebra there is a unique set theoretical universe such that
the internal "real numbers" bijectively correspond to the observables
affiliated with the given von Neumann algebra. Here, we show that a set
theoretical universe is associated with a beable subalgebra if and only if it
is ZFC-satisfiable, namely, every theorem of ZFC set theory holds with
probability equal to unity. Moreover, we show that there is a unique maximal
ZFC-satisfiable subuniverse "implicitly definable", in the sense of Malament
and others, by the given measurement context. The set theoretical language for
the ZFC-satisfiable universe, characterized by the present work, rigorously
reconstructs Bohr's notion of the "classical language" to describe the beables
in a given measurement context.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The development of classical ergodic theory has had a significant impact in
the areas of mathematics, physics, and, in general, applied sciences. The
quantum ergodic theory of Hamiltonian dynamics has its motivations to
understand thermodynamics and statistical mechanics and is still debated a lot.
Quantum channel, a completely positive trace-preserving map, represents a most
general representation of quantum dynamics and is an essential aspect of
quantum information theory and quantum computation. In this work, we study the
ergodic theory of quantum channels by characterizing different levels of
ergodic hierarchy from integrable to mixing. The quantum channels on single
systems are constructed from the unitary operators acting on bipartite states
and tracing out the environment. The interaction strength of these unitary
operators measured in terms of operator entanglement provides sufficient
conditions for the channel to be mixing. By using block diagonal unitary
operators, we construct a set of non-ergodic channels. From integrable to
mixing is characterized explicitly in the case of the two-qubit unitary
operator. Moreover, we also study interacting many-body quantum systems that
include the famous Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and show that they display
mixing within the framework of the quantum channel.

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) is a network of optical parametric oscillators
that solves combinatorial optimization problems by finding the ground state of
an Ising Hamiltonian. In CIMs, a problem arises when attempting to realize the
Zeeman term because of the mismatch in size between interaction and Zeeman
terms due to the variable amplitude of the optical parametric oscillator pulses
corresponding to spins. There have been three approaches proposed so far to
address this problem for CIM, including the absolute mean amplitude method, the
auxiliary spin method, and the chaotic amplitude control (CAC) method. This
paper focuses on the efficient implementation of Zeeman terms within the
mean-field CIM model, which is a physics-inspired heuristic solver without
quantum noise. With the mean-field model, computation is easier than with more
physically accurate models, which makes it suitable for implementation in field
programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and large-scale simulations. Firstly, we
examined the performance of the mean-field CIM model for realizing the Zeeman
term with the CAC method, as well as their performance when compared to a more
physically accurate model. Next, we compared the CAC method to other Zeeman
term realization techniques on the mean-field model and a more physically
accurate model. In both models, the CAC method outperformed the other methods
while retaining similar performance.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Quipper and Proto-Quipper are a family of quantum programming languages that,
by their nature as circuit description languages, involve two runtimes: one at
which the program generates a circuit and one at which the circuit is executed,
normally with probabilistic results due to measurements. Accordingly, the
language distinguishes two kinds of data: parameters, which are known at
circuit generation time, and states, which are known at circuit execution time.
Sometimes, it is desirable for the results of measurements to control the
generation of the next part of the circuit. Therefore, the language needs to
turn states, such as measurement outcomes, into parameters, an operation we
call dynamic lifting. The goal of this paper is to model this interaction
between the runtimes by providing a general categorical structure enriched in
what we call "bisets". We demonstrate that the biset-enriched structure
achieves a proper semantics of the two runtimes and their interaction, by
showing that it models a variant of Proto-Quipper with dynamic lifting. The
present paper deals with the concrete categorical semantics of this language,
whereas a companion paper deals with the syntax, type system, operational
semantics, and abstract categorical semantics.

<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Diagrammatic representations of quantum algorithms and circuits offer novel
approaches to their design and analysis. In this work, we describe extensions
of the ZX-calculus especially suitable for parameterized quantum circuits, in
particular for computing observable expectation values as functions of or for
fixed parameters, which are important algorithmic quantities in a variety of
applications ranging from combinatorial optimization to quantum chemistry. We
provide several new ZX-diagram rewrite rules and generalizations for this
setting. In particular, we give formal rules for dealing with linear
combinations of ZX-diagrams, where the relative complex-valued scale factors of
each diagram must be kept track of, in contrast to most previously studied
single-diagram realizations where these coefficients can be effectively
ignored. This allows us to directly import a number useful relations from the
operator analysis to ZX-calculus setting, including causal cone and quantum
gate commutation rules. We demonstrate that the diagrammatic approach offers
useful insights into algorithm structure and performance by considering several
ansatze from the literature including realizations of hardware-efficient
ansatze and QAOA. We find that by employing a diagrammatic representation,
calculations across different ansatze can become more intuitive and potentially
easier to approach systematically than by alternative means. Finally, we
outline how diagrammatic approaches may aid in the design and study of new and
more effective quantum circuit ansatze.

  Phase gadgets have proved to be an indispensable tool for reasoning about
ZX-diagrams, being used in optimisation and simulation of quantum circuits and
the theory of measurement-based quantum computation. In this paper we study
phase gadgets for qutrits. We present the flexsymmetric variant of the original
qutrit ZX-calculus, which allows for rewriting that is closer in spirit to the
original (qubit) ZX-calculus. In this calculus phase gadgets look as you would
expect, but there are non-trivial differences in their properties. We devise
new qutrit-specific tricks to extend the graphical Fourier theory of qubits,
resulting in a translation between the 'additive' phase gadgets and a
'multiplicative' counterpart we dub phase multipliers.
  This enables us to generalise the qubit notion of multiple-control to qutrits
in two ways. The first type is controlling on a single tritstring, while the
second type applies the gate a number of times equal to the tritwise
multiplication modulo 3 of the control qutrits.We show how both types of
control can be implemented for any qutrit Z or X phase gate, ancilla-free, and
using only Clifford and phase gates. The first requires a polynomial number of
gates and exponentially small phases, while the second requires an exponential
number of gates, but constant sized phases. This is interesting, because such a
construction is not possible in the qubit setting.
  As an application of these results we find a construction for emulating
arbitrary qubit diagonal unitaries, and specifically find an ancilla-free
emulation for the qubit CCZ gate that only requires three single-qutrit
non-Clifford gates, provably lower than the four T gates needed for qubits with
ancilla.

  We give a presentation by generators and relations of the group of Clifford+T
operators on two qubits. The proof relies on an application of the
Reidemeister-Schreier theorem to an earlier result of Greylyn, and has been

**Lower Bounds on Error Exponents via a New Quantum Decoder**—2023-10-13 (updated: 2023-11-15)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09014v2)]<br/>Salman Beigi, Marco Tomamichel
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We introduce a new quantum decoder based on a variant of the pretty good
measurement, but defined via an alternative matrix quotient. We use this
decoder to show new lower bounds on the error exponent both in the one-shot and
asymptotic regimes for the classical-quantum and the entanglement-assisted
channel coding problem. Our bounds are expressed in terms of measured (for the
one-shot bounds) and sandwiched (for the asymptotic bounds) channel R\'enyi
mutual information of order between 1/2 and 1. Our results are not comparable
with some previously established bounds for general instances, yet they are
tight (for rates close to capacity) when the underlying channel is classical.

**Observation of the Quantum Zeno Effect on a NISQ Device**—2023-10-12 (updated: 2023-11-15)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08317v2)]<br/>Andrea Alessandrini, Carola Ciaramelletti, Simone Paganelli

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We study the Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) on a single qubit on IBM Quantum
Experience devices under the effect of multiple measurements. We consider two
possible cases: the Rabi evolution and the free decay. In both cases we observe
the occurrence of the QZE as an increasing of the survival probability with the
number of measurements.

**Unravelling Interaction and Temperature Contributions in Unpolarized Trapped Fermionic Atoms in the BCS Regime**—2023-11-15—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08853v1)]<br/>Sejung Yong, Sian Barbosa, Jennifer Koch, Felix Lang, Axel Pelster, Artur Widera
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  In the BCS limit density profiles for unpolarized trapped fermionic clouds of
atoms are largely featureless. Therefore, it is a delicate task to analyze them
in order to quantify their respective interaction and temperature
contributions. Temperature measurements have so far been mostly considered in
an indirect way, where one sweeps isentropically from the BCS to the BEC limit.
Instead we suggest here a direct thermometry, which relies on measuring the
column density and comparing the obtained data with a Hartree-Bogoliubov
mean-field theory combined with a local density approximation. In case of an
attractive interaction between two-components of $^{6}$Li atoms trapped in a
tri-axial harmonic confinement we show that minimizing the error within such an
experiment-theory collaboration turns out to be a reasonable criterion for
analyzing in detail measured densities and, thus, for ultimately determining
the sample temperatures. The findings are discussed in view of various possible
sources of errors.

**A Natural Field-like Entanglement Resource in Trapped-Ion Chains**—2023-11-15—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08842v1)]<br/>Natalie Klco, D. H. Beck
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The electromagnetic trapping of ion chains can be regarded as a process of
non-trivial entangled quantum state preparation within Hilbert spaces of the
local axial motional modes. To begin uncovering properties of this entanglement
resource produced as a byproduct of conventional ion-trap quantum information
processing, the quantum continuous-variable formalism is herein utilized to
focus on the leading-order entangled ground state of local motional modes in
the presence of a quadratic trapping potential. The decay of entanglement
between disjoint subsets of local modes is found to exhibit features of
entanglement structure and response to partial measurement reminiscent of the
free massless scalar field vacuum. With significant fidelities between the two,
even for large system sizes, a framework is established for initializing
quantum field simulations via "imaging" extended entangled states from natural
sources, rather than building correlations through deep circuits of few-body
entangling operators. By calculating probabilities in discrete Fock subspaces
of the local motional modes, considerations are presented for locally
transferring these pre-distributed entanglement resources to the qudits of ion
internal energy levels, improving this procedure's anticipated experimental
viability.

**Atomic diffraction from single-photon transitions in gravity and Standard-Model extensions**—2023-09-05 (updated: 2023-11-15)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02051v2)]<br/>Alexander Bott, Fabio Di Pumpo, Enno Giese
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Single-photon transitions are one of the key technologies for designing and
operating very-long-baseline atom interferometers tailored for terrestrial
gravitational-wave and dark-matter detection. Since such setups aim at the
detection of relativistic and beyond-Standard-Model physics, the analysis of
interferometric phases as well as of atomic diffraction must be performed to
this precision and including these effects. In contrast, most treatments
focused on idealized diffraction so far. Here, we study single-photon
transitions, both magnetically-induced and direct ones, in gravity and
Standard-Model extensions modeling dark matter as well as
Einstein-equivalence-principle violations. We take into account relativistic
effects like the coupling of internal to center-of-mass degrees of freedom,
induced by the mass defect, as well as the gravitational redshift of the
diffracting light pulse. To this end, we also include chirping of the light
pulse required by terrestrial setups, as well as its associated modified
momentum transfer for single-photon transitions.

**Entanglement dynamics with string measurement operators**—2023-03-13 (updated: 2023-11-15)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07102v3)]<br/>Giulia Piccitto, Angelo Russomanno, Davide Rossini
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We explain how to apply a Gaussian-preserving operator to a fermionic
Gaussian state. We use this method to study the evolution of the entanglement
entropy of an Ising spin chain following a Lindblad dynamics with string
measurement operators, focusing on the quantum-jump unraveling of such
Lindbladian. We find that the asymptotic entanglement entropy obeys an area law
for finite-range string operators and a volume law for ranges of the string
which scale with the system size. The same behavior is observed for the
measurement-only dynamics, suggesting that measurements can play a leading role
in this context.

**Dynamical characterization of $Z_{2}$ Floquet topological phases via quantum quenches**—2023-10-31 (updated: 2023-11-15)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00114v2)]<br/>Lin Zhang
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  The complete characterization of a generic $d$-dimensional Floquet
topological phase is usually hard for the requirement of information about the
micromotion throughout the entire driving period. In a recent work [L. Zhang et
al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 183001 (2020)], an experimentally feasible dynamical
detection scheme was proposed to characterize the integer Floquet topological
phases using quantum quenches. However, this theory is still far away from
completion, especially for free-fermion Floquet topological phases, where the
states can also be characterized by $Z_{2}$ invariants. Here we develop the
first full and unified dynamical characterization theory for the $Z_{2}$
Floquet topological phases of different dimensionality and tenfold-way symmetry
classes by quenching the system from a trivial and static initial state to the
Floquet topological regime through suddenly changing the parameters and turning
on the periodic driving. By measuring the minimal information of Floquet bands
via the stroboscopic time-averaged spin polarizations, we show that the
topological spin texture patterns emerging on certain discrete momenta of
Brillouin zone called the $0$ or $\pi$ gap highest-order band-inversion
surfaces provide a measurable dynamical $Z_{2}$ Floquet invariant, which
uniquely determines the Floquet boundary modes in the corresponding quasienergy
gap and characterizes the $Z_{2}$ Floquet topology. The applications of our
theory are illustrated via one- and two-dimensional models that are accessible
in current quantum simulation experiments. Our work provides a highly feasible
way to detect the $Z_{2}$ Floquet topology and completes the dynamical
characterization for the full tenfold classes of Floquet topological phases,
which shall advance the research in theory and experiments.

**Tunable non-additivity in Casimir-Lifshitz force between graphene gratings**—2023-06-30 (updated: 2023-11-15)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17640v2)]<br/>Youssef Jeyar, Minggang Luo, Kevin Austry, Brahim Guizal, Yi Zheng, H. B. Chan, Mauro Antezza
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  We investigate the Casimir-Lifshitz force (CLF) between two identical
graphene strip gratings, laid on finite dielectric substrates, by using the
scattering matrix (S-matrix) approach derived from the Fourier Modal Method
with Local Basis Functions (FMM-LBF). We fully take into account the high-order
electromagnetic diffractions, the multiple scattering and the exact 2D feature
of the graphene strips. We show that the non-additivity, which is one of the
most interesting features of the CLF in general, is significantly high and can
be modulated in situ, without any change in the actual material geometry and
this by varying the graphene chemical potential. We discuss the nature of the
geometrical effects and show the relevance of the geometric parameter d/D (i.e.
the ratio between separation and grating period), which allows to explore the
regions of parameters where the additive result is fully acceptable or where
the full calculation is needed. This study can open to deeper experimental
exploration of the non-additive features of the CLF with micro- or
nano-electromechanical graphene-based systems.

**The Thermomajorization Polytope and Its Degeneracies**—2022-12-08 (updated: 2023-11-15)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04305v3)]<br/>Frederik vom Ende, Emanuel Malvetti
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  It is well known that the future thermal cone -- which is the set of all
states thermomajorized by a given initial state -- forms a convex polytope in
the quasi-classical realm, and that one can explicitly write down a map which
relates the permutations to the extreme points of this polytope. Given any such
extreme point we review a formula for a Gibbs-stochastic matrix that maps the
initial state to said extremal state, and we uncover the simple underlying
structure. This allows us to draw a connection to the theory of transportation
polytopes, which leads to the notions of "well-structured" and "stable" Gibbs
states. While the former relates to the number of extremal states being
maximal, the latter characterizes when thermomajorization is a partial order in
the quasi-classical realm; this corresponds to the impossibility of cyclic
state transfers. Moreover, we give simple criteria for degeneracy of the
polytope, that is, for checking whether the extreme point map maps two
different permutations to the same state.

**Pauli principle in polaritonic chemistry**—2023-07-07 (updated: 2023-11-15)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03508v4)]<br/>Tamás Szidarovszky
<details> <summary>

 **Abstract** </summary> 
  Consequences of enforcing permutational symmetry, as required by the Pauli
principle (spin-statistical theorem), on the state space of molecular ensembles
interacting with the quantized radiation mode of a cavity are discussed. The
Pauli-allowed collective states are obtained by means of group theory, i.e., by
projecting the state space onto the appropriate irreducible representations of
the permutation group of the indistinguishable molecules. It is shown that with
increasing number of molecules the ratio of Pauli-allowed collective states
decreases very rapidly. Bosonic states are more abundant than fermionic states,
and the brightness of Pauli-allowed state space (contribution from photon
excited states) increases(decreases) with increasing fine structure in the
energy levels of the material ground(excited) state manifold. Numerical results
are shown for the realistic example of rovibrating H$_2$O molecules interacting
with an infrared (IR) cavity mode.
